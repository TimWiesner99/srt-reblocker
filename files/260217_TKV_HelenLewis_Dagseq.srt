1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,600
In you.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,120
All right.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,120
Okay.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,480
So, before that,

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,480
I would like to start with the picture
to introduce yourself.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,080
My name is Helen Lewis,
and I'm the author of the Genius myth.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,960
And we also include an introduction.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,760
Could you do it again?

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,760
But, tell me a little bit more
about what you do with your.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,560
Yeah.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,320
I'm Helen Lewis.

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,760
My day job is a staff writer at the
Atlantic magazine and American Magazine.

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,640
And I'm the author of Difficult Women
A History of Feminism.

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,720
In 11 Fights.

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,160
And my new book, The Genius Myth. And,

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,640
So I've read your book,
and one of the questions

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,640
I started feeling was,

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,400
what did the geniuses of her do to you, to
this is this kind of freedom?

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,840
I think it's funny that people think
that I'm doing a kind of hatchet job

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,040
on the idea of genius,
because I try and say really early on,

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,800
I love this idea
of there being wonder in the world

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,560
of looking at achievements and feeling
that they're almost superhuman.

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,480
You know, that there's

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,480
I kind of think of it
a bit like the way that geniuses work,

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,400
and the world is a bit like walking
with dinosaurs, right?

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,720
We're just these little tiny,
insignificant figures,

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,640
and it's kind of amazing

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,120
to have and big personalities,
huge achievements around us.

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,960
But when you have a story
that, that, that is that powerful,

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,000
then that power can be used
in kind of bad ways too.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,400
And so I took a bit quantify
a bit about the dark side of genius.

32
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,440
You know, the way that people around
the genius get written out of history,

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,760
the way that perhaps it's not very good

34
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,800
for people themselves to be called
geniuses?

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,920
It kind of poisons them.

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,440
It makes them,

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,120
you know, when you're only famous
for something, some great gift or talent,

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,160
trying to kind of come

39
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,160
into an idea of yourself
as a kind of human worthy human person,

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,160
as a father or mother or child or friend,
whatever it might be.

41
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,080
I think people can find that
quite difficult.

42
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,320
People often find immense
talent to be a burden, as well as a gift.

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,840
And so you would say

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,000
it's not a hatchet book,
so you would say it's not a hatchet job.

45
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,280
It's not a hatchet
job on talent or achievement.

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,200
What it is,
is a deconstruction of this idea.

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,720
I'm really fascinating the fact
that, you know, we've all probably said

48
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,600
the word genius to describe
someone who's a genius casually

49
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,480
or at least once in the last week.

50
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,880
But, you know, what do we
what do we actually mean by it?

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,680
And how is that word changed over time?

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,440
So I try to, first of all,
take a historical look and say, well,

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
the really interesting thing

54
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,880
is that to the Greeks and Romans, genius
was something that you had.

55
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,240
It wasn't something you were.

56
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,960
You had a genius that spoke through you.

57
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,280
And that's really in the early Christian
Europe.

58
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,880
A similar version of
that would have held two. Right.

59
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,480
If you built a great cathedral
in the 1200s.

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,600
It wasn't
about your incredible achievement.

61
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,800
It was about God working through you.

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,280
And it's really

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,280
when you get to the Renaissance
and then later to the enlightenment,

64
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,480
the 18th century,

65
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,200
and the kind of growth of secularism
that people become more comfortable with.

66
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,040
This idea that there are,
you know, little gods, quasi

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,880
divine beings that walk among us.

68
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:02,040
So you can in some ways say that the genius replaced God in Europe and in America.

69
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,480
And if you

70
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,520
and the book's title,
you say in the book's title, you say

71
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,640
genius, the genius myth.

72
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,880
Let me rephrase it.

73
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,440
Your book's title.

74
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,760
You say the genius
myth is a dangerous idea.

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,120
Why is it dangerous?

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,280
Well, I think what happens often is that
it distorts our view of of achievement.

77
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,160
And there are particular types of people
who are more likely to be called genius.

78
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,760
You know, let's not be around
the bush. It's more like to be white man.

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,840
That's not necessarily a problem.

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,160
Some of my favorite people in the world
are white men,

81
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,240
but it means that if you are a woman
who achieves enormous things,

82
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,720
if you are African-American,
if you are Jewish, if you are Asian,

83
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,960
then actually sometimes you find yourself
not getting that label

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,760
and it's nothing to do with you
or your achievement.

85
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,560
It's about all kind of cultural ideas
about what a hero should be.

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
And I think the thing that really
I found most strongly

87
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,640
when I was reading this book is
this is a book about hero worship.

88
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,160
It's a book about who we put on a pedestal
and what that does for us.

89
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,880
You know what it says about us.

90
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,080
You know,
if I ask you what your favorite book is

91
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,720
or your favorite record,
you might be embarrassed if it's something

92
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,600
you might be embarrassed to say.

93
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,280
Harry Potter, because you're an adult
and you think, no, I should.

94
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,160
I should definitely say, you know, it's

95
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,680
more an pace
that'll make me look more impressive.

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,720
And there's a similar thing going on
with who we know as a genius, right?

97
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,120
It says something about us.

98
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,480
It says I have exquisite taste
or I value this in another human being.

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,080
And so that relationship
between the normal people

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,240
and the geniuses is also,
to me, completely fascinating.

101
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,040
That that's, that's I wanted

102
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,040
to ask you a bit more about that later,
but I was I was wondering first,

103
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,320
one of the other questions
I had when reading your book was,

104
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,920
don't we also need unions
to solve the big problems of our time?

105
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,400
You know, I.

106
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,960
Who else is going to do it?

107
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,200
Well, that's the great man
theory of history, right?

108
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,000
Which is the idea

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,440
that things move forward essentially
because of one incredible individual.

110
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,920
And I think there is something to that.

111
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,800
I've said to say that's a Victorian idea.

112
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,640
It comes from a

113
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,120
a brilliant series of essays by Thomas
Carlyle on the uses of great men.

114
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,480
And the thing that's interesting

115
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,640
about going that going back
is you assume everybody in the Victorian

116
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,640
age was completely on board
with the idea of great men.

117
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,560
Thomas Carlyle wrote those essays
defensively as a defense of hero worship.

118
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,600
And there were sociologists at the time,
like Herbert Spencer,

119
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
who immediately said, well, actually,
let's talk about social forces.

120
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,600
So it wasn't even then.

121
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
It wasn't
an uncomplicated, uncontested idea.

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,480
But I do think it has some merit.

123
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,600
I think that Donald Trump is a world
historical figure.

124
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,760
I think that Stalin is, you know,
the history of Russia in Communist

125
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,760
Russia plays out very differently
with that, that unique personality of him,

126
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,560
whatever it might be in politics.

127
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,040
I think that is really true, that,
you know, a Napoleon,

128
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,040
that the history of France is different,

129
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,840
just without that singular
figure of Napoleon.

130
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,840
But and this is the work of,
you know, the trend of most historians,

131
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,000
I think, in the 20th century,

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
to be also interested in the interaction
between the person and the their time.

133
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,080
And what's interesting to me about science
now is there's a huge dispute going on

134
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,000
about the fact that,
you know, Nobel Prizes,

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,840
for example, in the sciences,
are awarded to a maximum of three people.

136
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,400
That's really difficult.

137
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,440
If you look at something like the Large
Hadron Collider in Switzerland,

138
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,840
which is aiming to find out
the most fundamental

139
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,680
building blocks of the universe.

140
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,160
That's a collaboration between scientists
from several dozen

141
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,240
countries, hundreds of scientists.

142
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,720
If they find out something, it's
going to be quite arbitrary to say

143
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,880
it was this guy. It was this woman.

144
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,760
You know, there are so many scientific
discoveries to that.

145
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,760
Two people came up
with at exactly the same time.

146
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,680
You know, the telephone famously,

147
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,680
the two people registered the patent
for that on the same day.

148
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,080
So you can get too hung up on the idea
that because I think, you know, as humans,

149
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
we love stories.

150
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,720
A person did a thing,
and that's how history works.

151
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,040
Sometimes two people do the same thing.

152
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,800
Some times it takes a whole
bunch of people doing the same thing

153
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,880
at the same time.

154
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,760
The coronavirus vaccine
is another really good example.

155
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,200
I think you had scientists in China
who sequenced the genome of the virus

156
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,320
that was incredibly
important piece of work.

157
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,560
And then you had several labs
independently

158
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,200
working on different types of vaccine,
sometimes sharing some information.

159
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,440
And then you had this incredible
logistic mechanism

160
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,640
of getting that virus off, getting that
vaccine to the virus into people's arms.

161
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,960
So who who made the Covid vaccine is not,
you know, it's very

162
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,520
if you if you're going to give one person
the prize for that,

163
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,440
that's kind of inherently unfair.

164
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,680
So that's part of a.

165
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,120
I think the people I talked to
most was the Turkish.

166
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,400
German couple. Right. Right. Yeah.

167
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,960
But the people that we had sort of saw
as the genius.

168
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,480
Yeah.

169
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,760
And you know, very often it's about
who's got the most compelling story.

170
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,560
So there are versions of that.

171
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,880
Is it a woman who was overlooked
her entire lab career?

172
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Is it an immigrant
who was discriminated against and,

173
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,680
you know, grew up
in really tough circumstances?

174
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,160
First person
and family went to university.

175
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,280
Is it a guy?

176
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,640
This often happens
with scientific geniuses.

177
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,520
Is it a guy who has some.

178
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,960
Yeah, neurodivergent at the same time.

179
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,600
So we're kind of impressed by the fact
that somebody who struggles in

180
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
everyday life
has these incredibly brilliant insights

181
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,440
and and every example
I've given that gives you an idea of

182
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,240
what we're looking for in the genius myth,

183
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,200
which is something bittersweet,
a sense of struggle.

184
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,600
You get something,
but something is taken from you.

185
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,160
Something is withheld from you.

186
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,040
There's a brilliant book about genius.

187
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,000
It's called The Price of Greatness,

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,480
and I think that is key
to our understanding of genius.

189
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,360
We always feel that greatness has a price.

190
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,680
And we just can't stand if people are just
happy and a genius, right?

191
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,840
It feels wrong.

192
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,480
And some of that is the legacy
I think of the romantics

193
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,840
who came up with this idea
of the tortured genius.

194
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,400
There's a line.

195
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,640
I think it's, Byron, we have
the craft are all crazy.

196
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,480
You know, the idea that
if you wanted to be a really good poet,

197
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,120
what you absolutely
couldn't be is a nice middle class guy.

198
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,920
Just. Oh, I let's,
you know, have some lovely flowers.

199
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,640
Like I write a poem.

200
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,760
Now, you had to be tortured.

201
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,600
You had to be an alcoholic.

202
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,400
You had to have tuberculosis.
You had to be bisexual.

203
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,640
You had to have these challenges
and tensions in your life

204
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,640
that kind of brought forth great art.

205
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,600
I think, you know, I think,

206
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,520
you can really see this in the difference
between Rembrandt and Van Gough.

207
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,480
We don't have

208
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,720
that kind of mythology about Rembrandt,
that he was tortured.

209
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
He was, you know, an interesting example.

210
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,280
And he really loved doing
mythological scenes, big, huge canvases.

211
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,920
What we love about Rembrandt
now is the light in his portraits.

212
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,880
So we have a very different idea
of what his talent is.

213
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,320
But, you know, he made a very solid living
doing portraits

214
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,280
of middle class,
you know, Dutch merchants, right?

215
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,920
He didn't have that addiction to the 18th
century and 19th century genius myth

216
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,640
that you had to be miserable and unhappy
or the art didn't really count.

217
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Somehow.

218
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,680
I was reminded, by the way,
with what you said about the great men.

219
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,360
There's this,

220
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,280
faux focus quote who said,

221
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,560
that the finance minister of Germany
can only do

222
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
the finance minister of Germany
like these positions, in a sense.

223
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
And he said, I don't have

224
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,400
anything personally against him
because all these people are just

225
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
colors in the machine.

226
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,880
And and so

227
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,360
where do you stand on the union?

228
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,720
You do think that sometimes there is
some form of great man or woman who can?

229
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,080
I think sometimes things do come down
to, decisions.

230
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,560
I think probably more rarely than you
think.

231
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Something that someone told me recently,
which I thought was fascinating,

232
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,280
is that we often

233
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,240
have this idea of this is the battle
that changed the course of the war.

234
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,160
This is the pivotal battle.

235
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,280
And it's quite
that is also quite often a myth,

236
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,760
you know, but it's just it appeals to us.

237
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,960
The storytelling of it is it is better.

238
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,160
But, you know,
this is partially an argument

239
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,600
between the political left and the
political right, which I find fascinating.

240
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,120
You know, I got into trouble for saying
that genius is a right wing concept

241
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,560
because it is.

242
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,680
It's about the individual. Right.

243
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,360
And if you think about where the,
the economic right,

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,040
of argument has been over the last couple
of decades, it's about

245
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,440
unleashing entrepreneurs, innovation,
you know, letting people

246
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,680
not taxing them too much
so that they can fulfill their,

247
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,960
you know, their destiny
and be big figures.

248
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,560
And the left has emphasized more equality,
giving everybody a fair chance,

249
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,120
maybe not making such a big difference
between the top and the bottom of society.

250
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,400
And genius is quite challenging to that.

251
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,800
In its extreme manifestations.

252
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,240
It's about saying,
some people are so brilliant

253
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,360
and so wonderful,

254
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,520
they should be allowed to do pretty much
whatever they want, and it doesn't matter

255
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,720
what effect
they have on the people around them.

256
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,480
We need that.

257
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,360
If you want to have science,

258
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,680
if you want to have gravity,
if you want to have Guernica,

259
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,840
you have to just let these people do
what they whatever they want.

260
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,680
And they deserve all the yeah, they get
and all the credits and all.

261
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,000
The I'm inversion.

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,360
This is playing out in Silicon Valley
right now, you know, how should you know?

263
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,520
Should,

264
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,360
an AI company become the first kind of,
you know, multitrillion dollar company?

265
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,920
And will that accrue to maybe 5
or 6 people who were its founders?

266
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,400
You know, this
extreme levels of new Gilded Age

267
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,720
wealth will do, you know,
does Elon Musk deserve all that money?

268
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,880
Would those companies exist without him?

269
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,840
They that's what they think, right?

270
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,920
You know, he's been voted by his boards
enormous share packages.

271
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,360
When Sam Altman was forced out of OpenAI,
there was a revolt to bring him back

272
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,080
because the feeling was is the company
he makes all this value.

273
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,000
But you do have.

274
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,360
You invested money when you do take into,

275
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,120
do you think

276
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,120
he deserves
or do you think he deserves to be?

277
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,720
Do you think he deserves that position
that he did that

278
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,800
so that it could have been?

279
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,160
Do you think it could have been done
without.

280
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,200
It's very difficult, isn't it,
because you always wonder whether or not

281
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,000
someone would have succeeded.

282
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And it happens to be him.

283
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,200
I think he if you read the Walter Isaacson
biography of him, Walter Isaacson

284
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,200
said, is
he has an extreme tolerance for risk,

285
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
and I think we should give him
credit for that.

286
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,160
But what that means is he's made a lot of
1 in 1000 bets, and he's the person.

287
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,400
He's the 1 in 1000 person for whom
those bets have come off.

288
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,560
There's probably 999 Elon Musks
who are bankrupt, right?

289
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Or whose idea never took off
or weren't there at the right time.

290
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,320
And so I, you know,
I think to give him credit

291
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,120
for starting these companies
and driving those projects forward.

292
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,600
Absolutely. I would do that.

293
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,120
I would also emphasize the role of luck.

294
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,680
And I would also emphasize the role

295
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,680
of, you know,
you don't build a rocket on your own.

296
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,720
A lot of

297
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,120
success in those kind of businesses
is hiring the right kind of talent.

298
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,720
And and having a vision as a leader
that makes people want to work for you.

299
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,320
One of my favorite biopics
is is Oppenheimer

300
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,080
and Recent Years, because it's about being
a really great manager,

301
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,160
and you just don't get that.

302
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,520
Normally it's about it's about
you're the great scientist.

303
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,480
You're the great painter.
You're the great writer.

304
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,000
No. What about someone
who's not that good at physics himself?

305
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,880
I mean, better than let's be.

306
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,480
Maybe you were amazing in physics,
but in the me in physics.

307
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,440
But not better than Enrico Fermi.

308
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,360
Not better than John von Neumann.

309
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,880
He's not the greatest physicist,

310
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,880
but he's the only person
who can bring those people together.

311
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,120
And I think we underrate those figures

312
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,120
because it's harder to tell stories
about being a great manager.

313
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,640
And if you are, maybe that's
actually his talent in organizing this.

314
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
But we don't like to tell that story

315
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,640
about him, and we'd like to paint
it more as a genius.

316
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,240
Yeah. Has he had. Yeah.

317
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,600
Has he had any of the individual ideas or
made any of the individual breakthroughs?

318
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,240
Well, you could say one thing.

319
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,120
He's done it space-x

320
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,120
very successfully say
I want to use the cheapest possible parts.

321
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,920
I want these rockets to be reusable.

322
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,320
I just want to change the entire idea
of what it means to go to space.

323
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,280
I think I give him credit for that.

324
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,880
But yeah, you're right.

325
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,800
He you know, from everything we know
about how he runs his companies,

326
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,800
he is both incredibly
inspiring to work for,

327
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,080
but also manic.

328
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,080
And people love it for a bit
and then they hate it.

329
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,240
You know, and
I think that's kind of fascinating is that

330
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,600
the kind of relentless work
ethic again, it's bittersweet.

331
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,880
It's giving you something and taking
something people kind of like you.

332
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,920
And lots of Silicon Valley companies
have the air of a kind of cult,

333
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,240
and you join the cult and people
get a huge sense of meaning and purpose.

334
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,960
They're doing something extraordinary,

335
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,320
and it's
putting extraordinary demands on them.

336
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,440
But sometimes they come out

337
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,560
the other side of that experience
feeling absolutely battered.

338
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,400
I'm not sure.

339
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,680
Maybe you can't
have one without the other.

340
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,120
And I think the.

341
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,480
Guy, maybe what makes him

342
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,480
more exceptional is the fact
that he's not just two weeks old.

343
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,560
Right?

344
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,440
Building stuff in the world.

345
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,040
There's a great exchange between him
and the tech investor, Paul Graham, about

346
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,040
why maybe Elon Musk might be better at,

347
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,920
you know,
you might be better at building hardware,

348
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,680
which is interesting than software,
because actually, the big companies

349
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,880
in Silicon Valley for the last decade
or so have

350
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,960
mostly been software companies,
the ones that people are excited about.

351
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,360
Whereas, you know,
you think of the technical achievement

352
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,480
of space X of Tesla
and of something like Apple.

353
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,000
You know, Apple is

354
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,640
one of the richest companies in the world,
but that is based around

355
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,280
having an incredibly good supply
chain, actually.

356
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,920
Has it come out

357
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,280
with the kind of groundbreaking products
of the Steve Jobs era recently?

358
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,960
I arguably know what it is incredibly
good is making stuff.

359
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,920
And again, that's the kind of genius
that gets underrated in comparison to

360
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,560
conceptual genius.

361
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:34,760
Yeah.

362
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,400
That's interesting.

363
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,400
I could I feel the government is milk.

364
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,960
I think you might.

365
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,240
And there that you don't have to like it's
the things they are doing are like space

366
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,240
ish is like totally amazing with the

367
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,440
yeah machines that they're like,

368
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,880
but we can see that there's, there's

369
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,920
not someone, there's not a person
that you can see that achievements.

370
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,680
It's like a team effort.

371
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,800
Everybody knows that.

372
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,800
I remember people saying at NASA that,

373
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,000
you can be a leader.

374
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,560
We tell people that I have to put
a man on the moon, that kind of stuff.

375
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,080
That's, But those are like,
harder stories to mythologize, I guess.

376
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah. And that's why the word mess
is in the title of the book.

377
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,760
And because it's not there

378
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,360
to say that genius doesn't exist,
it's fair to say that it's a story,

379
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,800
and it's a story that we tell ourselves,
and it's got the qualities of a story.

380
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,920
That's the that's maybe because of
why is genius.

381
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,680
I mean.

382
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,880
Because, I mean, in the sense
of mythology, like Greek mythology,

383
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,880
it's a set of stories
about how we understand the world.

384
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,520
And it's not reality.

385
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,440
It's reality curved into, a method
that's palatable that that appeals to us.

386
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,360
You know, I think stories go undergo
a form of evolution by natural selection.

387
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,760
And I write about this in the book

388
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,600
they go through, you know,
when you hear the story of Picasso,

389
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,040
it gets told and retold and retold
and it kind of achieves

390
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,080
its final perfect form in the in the form
that is most satisfying to us.

391
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,520
And so, you know,
the people get hailed as geniuses.

392
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,760
They very often have a kind of caricature
of themselves that becomes famous.

393
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,880
Anyone who's becomes
famous will tell you that,

394
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,640
you know, it's quite a bruising experience
to find out that there's just

395
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,360
a weird, shaved off version of yourself
walking around out there

396
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,280
that people have strong opinions on,
but that definitely happens to genius.

397
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,440
We boil geniuses

398
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,320
down to a few kind of key essentials,
and that's the that's the mythology.

399
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,640
And also

400
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,600
we want that because it's easier
to have like a person or a face

401
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,680
to a certain idea or a certain industry
or a certain movement

402
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,400
than to have like a whole complex picture
of the whole idea of the whole movement.

403
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,160
Yeah.

404
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,720
And also it becomes a referendum
on whether or not you like it or not.

405
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,080
If I, you know, you and I can have

406
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,000
a very complicated conversation about AI
and frontier AI models and whether or not

407
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,880
we think that ultimately going to be good
for humanity above humanity, but that

408
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,280
that conversation is much easier to have
if we have it through.

409
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,720
Do you like what grok the ex
AI model is doing?

410
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,600
On on the ex service.

411
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,360
Do you like what do you think Sam
Altman is a visionary or is he a salesman?

412
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,720
Do you think Elon Musk is a genius

413
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,960
or a maniac or or both,
you know, or charlatan, right?

414
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,320
Actually, there's a lot of people
who will say to you

415
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,080
that, you know, Elon Musk
is is a charlatan.

416
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,880
So you you become kind of proxies, right?

417
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,840
They become aware of having a big,

418
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,440
complicated argument
boil down to one person essentially.

419
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,360
And that's a
that's a really useful function

420
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,360
that geniuses play in our society.

421
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,720
And there wouldn't be any,

422
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,440
y, why do people want to talk about these?

423
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,120
It's always fun to talk about people
who are weird,

424
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,760
and unusual and exciting, don't you think?

425
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,080
I mean,

426
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,200
I write in the book about the fact that,
you know,

427
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,360
I say I love the paintings of Van
Gogh, and I'm just.

428
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,400
There's something about looking at them

429
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,840
that just provokes
this huge emotion to me.

430
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,720
I don't know how.

431
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,840
I don't know how they exist.

432
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,640
You know, that, William Gibson line

433
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,440
that any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic.

434
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,480
I think that's how we feel about geniuses.

435
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,280
It's. It's magic, isn't it?

436
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,120
Just seeing some the fact that someone
was able to do that is extraordinary.

437
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,040
But, you know, the thing that you use, van
Gogh is an example.

438
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,440
He very successfully married
Post-Impressionist painting

439
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,600
and the techniques
that have come out of Impressionism

440
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,200
with his own influences
from Japan and Japanese woodblock prints.

441
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,000
And that doesn't undermine his talent.

442
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,040
And doing those things,
it makes the, you know,

443
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
makes the story to me
much more interesting.

444
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,160
But he sits at the collision
of two artistic traditions.

445
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,960
You could say the same thing
about Picasso.

446
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,760
He is an extremely good
conventional artist in his early years.

447
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,760
Then he becomes influenced
by African masks

448
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,880
and, and and by so-called primitive art.

449
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,400
And he paints the, you know,

450
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,200
Moselle d'Avignon,
which is his big Cubist breakthrough.

451
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,240
He sits at the kind of collision
of two traditions.

452
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,960
And that's not to say, you know, I'm
not by saying that.

453
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,560
I'm not saying Picasso wasn't talented,
incredibly talented.

454
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,360
I'm just saying
it's it's a more interesting

455
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,120
to look at him and his influences.

456
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,160
But we don't tend to do that.

457
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,360
We want we want the breakthrough.

458
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,920
And, you know, Would you say that makes,

459
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,280
would you say that it makes

460
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,960
the picture of the genius
more rich and more interesting?

461
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,320
I mean, I like it
more some people find it,

462
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,680
some people find it an attack.

463
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,800
I think they find that if you say someone
was heavily influenced by someone or,

464
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,840
you know, here's this, you know, pre
figuration of their work somewhere else,

465
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,120
they feel like you're, you're saying that
the other that person that they love,

466
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,400
you know, wasn't amazing, that they were
they were cheap or they were copying.

467
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,880
I feel a bit like a little bit
someone reading a book.

468
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,880
I had this feeling,
something that you just said and

469
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,560
I wasn't like,
I really like the conclusion.

470
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,440
But at some, some passages
I had the same feeling where I was like,

471
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,480
like you were demystifying something that
I held wholly, or you know what I mean?

472
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,800
Like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like.

473
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,160
This is not entirely,

474
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,600
not comfortable.

475
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,920
Yeah, maybe.

476
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,440
Yeah, I think,
but I think that's really interesting.

477
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,560
I don't know about you,
but I'm always interested in the things

478
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,120
that make me uncomfortable
and trying to understand what that is.

479
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,080
And I think I also think
that I can understand that happening now

480
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,400
in the wake of the decade
that we've just lived through,

481
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,960
where I think there was a lot of giant
killing and people were told,

482
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,960
I'm sorry, you can't like the movies
of Woody Allen anymore.

483
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,920
You can't like the Art of Picasso anymore.

484
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,400
You know, you can't like, go, go
because he spent time

485
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,760
in the South Pacific, you know,
you hear these people that you like.

486
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,760
You're not allowed to like them anymore
because they were bad people.

487
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,240
And I think there's been a backlash
to that, you know, and I and

488
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,520
I think it was a it was an unfair thing
to ask of people, if you really love

489
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,640
whatever it might be, if you really love
Annie Hall or Manhattan,

490
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,040
you don't have to sign off

491
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,040
on thinking that you know, everything
that Woody Allen does is amazing.

492
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,320
But people kind of
don't want that taken away from them.

493
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,120
I talked to someone who,

494
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,440
had a Michael Jackson song at her wedding.

495
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,240
She walked down the aisle
to Michael Jackson

496
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,120
and about how it felt to her
when the allegations of sex abuse

497
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,120
came out against him,
and the fact that now

498
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,400
something that meant so much to her,
you know, her wedding, her,

499
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,760
you know, one of the best days of her life
had this kind of like asterisk

500
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,760
next to it
that it was kind of contaminated by,

501
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,360
you know, by this, this whole discussion.

502
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
And I can understand

503
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,720
why people don't want things
that they love taken away from them.

504
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,520
You know, there's a big reaction
when it turns out that you get these

505
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,080
rediscovery, reappraisal of artists
or scientists, where we find out

506
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,480
that about their feet of clay
because people don't want that, you know,

507
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
I think
it happens in science as well as the arts.

508
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,320
You know, if you have a hero that you grow
up, and, you know, you worship them,

509
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,480
it's a bit like the process
where I think for teenagers,

510
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,480
when they find out that their parents
aren't kind of all knowing that,

511
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,480
that they can offer me
this intense disappointment.

512
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,600
But then hopefully you get

513
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,160
to the adult stage where you think
it's quite hard to be a parent.

514
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,520
They did their best
and and you forgive them.

515
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,280
And I think that's sort

516
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,280
of the adult version of where
you need to get to with hero worship,

517
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,720
which is I can accept that this person
wasn't perfect.

518
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,560
That doesn't affect
the things that I admire about them,

519
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,240
all the things that they produced
that I really like.

520
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,160
And part of it is that we actually
want them to be imperfect,

521
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,280
that we need genius to be imperfect.

522
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,040
Right. That's interesting.
What do you mean by that?

523
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
Well, they need to be flawed.

524
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,960
They need to be tormented.
They need to be. That's like what?

525
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,000
Why do you like them in the first place?
Or maybe not.

526
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,600
Why do you like it?

527
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,600
But those are
the stories that stand out amongst.

528
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,000
The stories of struggle.

529
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,400
Definitely the stories of genius
that stand out most.

530
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,440
And I think that's quite moving too,
because, you know,

531
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,560
I write in the book about Stephen Hawking,
who I think is a very good example.

532
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,440
You know, the physicist who had ALS

533
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,320
and progressive muscular dystrophy,
essentially, which put him in a wheelchair

534
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,480
and by the end was only able
to communicate by blinking his eyes,

535
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,360
but was contemplating these incredibly
difficult questions of physics.

536
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,520
And I think there's something about that
that is just mystical to us

537
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,520
that you would keep
striving and overcoming.

538
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,960
But if you read the work
of other physicists,

539
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,200
they will talk about how
that was quite uncomfortable.

540
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,320
The kind of celebrity cult around him
wasn't necessarily

541
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,320
good for his physics work. Probably not.

542
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,880
But it made him into a celebrity
in the way that his contemporaries,

543
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,320
somebody like Roger Penrose,
just just wasn't.

544
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,080
And there's a related version of that,

545
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,480
which is that
you want people to be interesting.

546
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,480
I mean, that sounds very obvious,
but it's been very difficult for,

547
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,360
people to reclaim geniuses about whom
we don't know

548
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,800
a great deal about their biography
because there is no mythology.

549
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,680
You can't build a sort of story
about that.

550
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,320
You know,
there's just there's just the work.

551
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,280
I think, and the controversy is
what makes them interesting.

552
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,720
And then I think maybe that's what I had

553
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,880
when I was reading this or that was like
feeling like that was being taken away.

554
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,840
I just did it was taking a away and and

555
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,920
being able to like,
where people just don't.

556
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,160
You should definitely like, wait,
I mean, I'm quite a weird person.

557
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm pro weird
people is a concept generally.

558
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,040
And I think one of the things
that's really beautiful

559
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,160
about reading the story of genius is that
you find that lots of people who are

560
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,800
very different and find it very hard

561
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,880
to accommodate themselves to society,

562
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,480
nonetheless achieve incredible things.

563
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,080
My first book was about feminism.

564
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,920
It was called Difficult Women,
and it was built around

565
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,720
this idea of difficulty, the idea
that if you want to change the world,

566
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,920
you have to be
it kind of at right angles to it.

567
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,520
You can't if you're somebody who is,
you know, grown up, very comfortable,

568
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,600
you're happy with the political situation
that you live in.

569
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,280
Life is working out really well for you.

570
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,480
You don't become a revolutionary.

571
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,760
You become a revolutionary
because there's something in you

572
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,520
that says this isn't right.

573
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,200
And you're also the kind of itchy,
obsessive, you know, difficult person

574
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,760
that is willing to stake their life
on, on making this change.

575
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,320
And I think that's the other thing.

576
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,560
I find very many of those similar types
come out in this book.

577
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,800
You find somebody like Isaac Newton,

578
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,640
you know, just a very fundamentally weird
but brilliant man.

579
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,680
And and those two things are indivisible.

580
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,680
The bit where I think it's
dangerous is the bit

581
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,280
where we say that people who aren't weird,
therefore aren't,

582
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,080
you know, aren't geniuses.

583
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,320
The idea that if you're well-adjusted
so, you know, it's boring.

584
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,680
And I think that's
that's a kind of fetishization of oddness

585
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,200
which doesn't necessarily help
the old people themselves,

586
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,400
that they have to be special

587
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,640
in order to get the kind of pass
for just being a bit different.

588
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
And they have to gradually

589
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:53,800
and they have to

590
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,800
gradually start acting more and more.

591
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,200
Well, I think celebrity does that.

592
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,280
Fame does that to anybody anyway. Yeah.

593
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,760
I don't think anybody I don't think any.

594
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,480
Does anyone become more normal
after they become famous?

595
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,320
I can't really think of anyone.

596
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Some of them become special
because they stay at home.

597
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,280
That that in itself is.

598
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,600
Yeah.

599
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,640
That's being that's that's the most
unusual thing to be Paul McCartney.

600
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,920
And still to be saying after 60 years
is one of the most famous

601
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,920
people in the world,
is an underrated achievement.

602
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,240
And, would you say area of society

603
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,480
and maybe the type of work or the art
that the genius has changed over time,

604
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,840
maybe you could you take us through
the evolution of what we consider genius?

605
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,520
Yeah.

606
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
I mean,
I think one of the foundational texts

607
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,880
and I write about it in the, in the book
is Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the artists.

608
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,480
And he had the who I had of great fortune
and a great misfortune.

609
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,640
His great fortune

610
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,480
was to be alive at the time where
some incredible artists were working.

611
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,640
So, Titian, just after Michelangelo,
Leonardo da Vinci.

612
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,320
I like this a bit, where I go into things
of thinking that the Ninja Turtles.

613
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,600
Donatello. Raphael.

614
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,280
But, you know,

615
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,160
so they had that, you know, in terms
of writing about the artist

616
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,160
who were working at his time,
what a time to be alive.

617
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,960
The great tragedies that he wasn't.

618
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,680
He was a he was a fine artist.

619
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,680
He was a mediocre, not mediocre,
was definitely a good artist,

620
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,520
but he wasn't Michelangelo.

621
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,040
And that must be it must be tough.

622
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,600
But he pitched essentially
to one of his aristocratic patrons

623
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,680
the idea of writing a group biography
of the lives of the artists.

624
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,560
And he did.

625
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,560
And it's where we get the idea,
really, of the Renaissance

626
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,760
from is the fact that he said,

627
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,360
look at all these people at the same time,
doing the same thing.

628
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,720
And so you can almost trace to him that

629
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,320
that idea of the genius,
the Renaissance genius.

630
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,480
And so, so when you say you would start

631
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,480
us, we started out
with the Renaissance man.

632
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,400
Yeah. A Renaissance man. Oh, yeah. Yeah,

633
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,720
I have the American.

634
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,960
Yeah. Right.

635
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Started out
with, with the Renaissance man.

636
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,960
And from there I was geniuses. Oh.

637
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,120
Yeah.

638
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,760
So yeah,

639
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,400
I think you get during the Renaissance,
the artist,

640
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,880
you know, who is, and and the
the word renaissance is,

641
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,360
is rebirth.

642
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,760
So it's about going back
to classical principles, and rediscovering

643
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,400
that tradition.

644
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,720
So that's baked into the idea of genius
that you are.

645
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,800
You know, this is a movement
that is doing something to art.

646
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,880
Then you move on to the I think the next
significant shift is the Romantics.

647
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,400
And I'm thinking
lots of the English poets in Byron Keats,

648
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,520
words, sorry, were the, for example,
being a, you know,

649
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,920
an important text there,
the idea of a tortured genius,

650
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,000
the poet really is
that is the kind of becomes the,

651
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,280
I think

652
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,960
Shelley calls the poets the unacknowledged
legislators of the world.

653
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,160
You know, the idea that these people write
writing sonnets about,

654
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,560
you know, bees or whatever it might be,
are actually changing the culture

655
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,040
in some way, which just we just
don't feel like that now about poetry.

656
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,400
We just don't.

657
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,560
We have to be tormented.

658
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,320
And they have to be tormented
because it is about the fact that, again,

659
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,840
you you've been given something, but you,
you know, there's a cost to it, too.

660
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,040
And I don't think you can
weirdly tell that story without reference

661
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,400
to tuberculosis,

662
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,480
which sounds like a very weird thing
to say, but it is the romantic disease.

663
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,600
Susan Sontag writes about this in illness
as a metaphor.

664
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,600
She writes about a difference
between the way that cancer is seen and,

665
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,600
tuberculosis or consumption,
as it would have been called,

666
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,880
because it's a disease that, you know,
you become very pale, you cough up blood,

667
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,080
you know, for men, it makes you sort of
more feminine in the sense of being weak.

668
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,640
These are the kind of archetypes of people
hang around it.

669
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,000
So there's this really weird line
from Byron where he says,

670
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,360
you know, I sort of,
I wish I had consumption.

671
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,480
It would be, wouldn't it

672
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,520
be much more romantic if I did,
if I was suffering in this, this way?

673
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,400
And so, yeah, the idea was that
that suffering brought you closer

674
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,760
to art,
to transcending being human, essentially.

675
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,560
And then I think, you know, in the 1900s,
maybe you move into this idea

676
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,640
more of the mechanical genius.

677
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,120
You know, this is the kind of age of
industrial, like, hyper industrialization.

678
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Somebody like, Thomas Edison,

679
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,520
the American inventor becomes incredibly
important to America's mythology.

680
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,720
So, yeah, sure.

681
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,560
Europe had all these the old masters, you
know, this was this is the old continent.

682
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,440
But here we're America
when you we're making stuff,

683
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,680
Edison is called the

684
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,640
American Prometheus, you know, after
the guy who stole fire from the gods.

685
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,760
So this is the idea that, you know,
America is just

686
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,520
is is forging the future,

687
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,480
and it's people, it's inventors
who are now the idea of genius.

688
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,720
And that mutates into the 20th century

689
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,160
dominant form of genius to me, anyway,
which is the kind of tech genius

690
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,960
which is a human who is has things
in common with a computer.

691
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,440
You know, they are incredibly good
at maths or engineering.

692
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,360
They make things that are,
again, futuristic.

693
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,080
But the price of that might be that
maybe they are socially awkward.

694
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,960
You know, the nerds essentially,
that kind of nerd genius is

695
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,920
is our dominant form.

696
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,080
And I think that's
I think that's still where we are today.

697
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,280
I'm kind of fascinated to know

698
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,240
what the next archetype will be,
but I genuinely don't don't know.

699
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,760
Is this,

700
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,800
you know, it's it's like, okay.

701
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,880
Yeah,

702
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,360
yeah, it's the culture was there.

703
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,000
It's.

704
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,560
I know you just said, you don't.

705
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,360
Know, I don't know, I really don't know.

706
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,280
But but,

707
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,760
maybe we can try to.

708
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,760
Okay. Weird. Very good.

709
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,360
Good brains.

710
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,360
If you see, like, our culture right now,

711
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,760
the tech rose,

712
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,760
the tech geniuses, they've been,

713
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,280
causing a lot of headlines in.

714
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,600
They're from the first
in our administration.

715
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,880
I think the last century.

716
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,000
You with the word genius.

717
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,120
We think of Einstein now.

718
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,080
I think people think of you a
of those kinds of, tech, CEOs.

719
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,640
Would you what would you hope

720
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,640
that our culture shifts in terms of,

721
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,400
calling people.

722
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,800
To just go outside?

723
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,800
So I'm all right.

724
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,440
So just silent, like.

725
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,320
I think that's.

726
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,400
Someone who's right, I said.

727
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Yeah.

728
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,560
I'm sorry.

729
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,120
And so, You

730
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,080
the fire next door?

731
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,880
Well, okay. Yeah.

732
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,960
Let me pick up on that. Yeah.

733
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,800
I think what's interesting about the
AI companies

734
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,760
is that way that they often

735
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,760
talk about their models,
they talk about them as geniuses,

736
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,160
which is really interesting.

737
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,920
You know, one of the things
that's not necessarily surprised me,

738
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,520
but I think has been very obvious,
is that people treat ChatGPT

739
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,440
or Claude or whatever
the name of the model is as a person.

740
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,040
And actually,
if you think if you if you read the way

741
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,040
that PSA people are anthropic
talk about Claude, which is their model,

742
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,160
they do talk about it.

743
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,000
Is this kind of quasi divine

744
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
being that they're kind of
in the same room with, I think there's a

745
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,840
we have an innate tendency
to anthropomorphize,

746
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,320
to see things as human,
even when they're not.

747
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,000
And I think that's something
that I've definitely seen

748
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,080
with with AI models, both from the users

749
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,080
and from the people who work with them,
who know the most closely.

750
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,560
Right?

751
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,600
You end up,
you start off by giving something a name,

752
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,600
and then before long you're worrying
about hurting its feelings,

753
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,760
which isn't a bad impulse at all.

754
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,280
But I you know,
I wonder if if we're now treating them,

755
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,760
you know, do we treat ChatGPT as a genius?

756
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,600
Essentially. Will they be?

757
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,960
When the
AI models become the next genius AI?

758
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,600
It's not that old an idea, really,
because they have many of the qualities

759
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,320
of a genius, right?

760
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Which is that they're sort of superhuman.

761
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,240
And we can't really understand
how they do what they do,

762
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,000
which is two great qualities of, you know,

763
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
about a great scientific discovery
or a brilliant painting.

764
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,360
All right.

765
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,160
You don't know how anyone you couldn't do

766
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,880
it, you don't know how anyone else
could have done it.

767
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,000
That's also how I feel about,
you know, about Claude, essentially.

768
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,440
Like what?

769
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,600
What is the thinking going on
here is the matching.

770
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,520
What is it?

771
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,680
So I think there's that.

772
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,360
The other side of it is
I wonder whether or not in a world

773
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,640
where computing power is so vast,

774
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,480
we move back to human experiences
and we value them highly.

775
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,400
You know.

776
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,280
Before we go, yeah.

777
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,360
But I was thinking
when you said the last thing,

778
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,000
they're also,

779
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
they're also actually socially quite.

780
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,440
Yeah, yeah. Well, yes.

781
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,800
In the opposite way to, to to tech browse.

782
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,880
I guess the myth of the tech, bro,
is that basically,

783
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,640
you know, you can't make eye contact,
don't know how to talk to girls.

784
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,560
And the problem
is a lot of the aim of AI models

785
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,760
is that they tend towards
being incredibly sycophantic.

786
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,440
Like, great idea, well done. You.

787
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,240
But yeah, in both cases it took.

788
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,520
Like somebody read.

789
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,680
Yeah to interact with people,
but yeah, you know how to do it.

790
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,680
But that's I think both of those are kind
of artifacts of the computer age that we,

791
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,480
we know so much of our lives

792
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,720
now, but our relationship with computers
and computing power that either

793
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,280
some people pride themselves
on thinking like computers

794
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,480
or we're interested in computers
trying to be human.

795
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,920
But, you know, the the kind of the side
effects of superabundance are fascinating,

796
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,920
which is that
what will people pay money for now?

797
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,680
They'll pay for experiences,
the things that are booming.

798
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,760
You know, I want to go on holiday
to the place I've seen on Instagram

799
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,160
and take a photo of me in front of my,
Fuji, you know, and have been there.

800
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,160
I want to go to Taylor Swift's concert
with 2 million

801
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,160
other people, and I'll pay
hundreds of pounds to do that.

802
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,240
You know, in a, you know,
you can listen to dinosaur songs

803
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,040
on Spotify for, you know, 0.0001 pence.

804
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,960
It's about now what are the things
that there's only a limited amount of,

805
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:06,960
you know, art.

806
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,200
You know,

807
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,680
I thought the theater would have
a real trouble bouncing back after Covid.

808
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,880
You know, it's it's struggled
in some senses, but one of the things

809
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,240
it's reliably generated
sales is having a, a celebrity casting

810
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,040
because there's only, you know,
there's only one Cynthia Erivo and you're

811
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,200
either in the room with Harry or not,
and people will pay an enormous

812
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,880
amount of money for that
because by definition, humans are limited.

813
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,720
Whereas we're now used to this world
of the internet and AI, which is just a,

814
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,920
you know, there's more stuff
than you could ever consume in a lifetime.

815
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,080
Yeah.

816
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,600
And think maybe the the
idea of the struggle is hard to imagine.

817
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,960
Also with a lack of food. Right.

818
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,600
I think is a great study about,
poetry written by AI

819
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,800
in which people actually,
when they were blind, tested on it.

820
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,600
They really liked AI written poetry,
but as soon as they found out

821
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,400
it was written by an AI,
they downgraded it again and again.

822
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,040
It's a defense of what do you want?
You want a human connection.

823
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,080
You want the fact that there's

824
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,720
only so much of something
that someone has to give.

825
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,400
You want a sense of connecting
with a human brain?

826
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,040
I think there's a there's
a quite a long bit in the book about

827
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,960
Hans Eisenach, who wrote a book on genius,
had this idea that the genius

828
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,280
should either die before 30 or after 80.

829
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,320
Really?

830
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,440
And and for the under 30s,
you know, for your Amy

831
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,200
Winehouse, James
Dean, River Phoenix, Keats.

832
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,760
You know,
the idea is that there's something, again,

833
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,280
bittersweet,
that there's not enough of them.

834
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,800
What could they have done? What would the
rest of that life look like?

835
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,120
You have to live to 80 in order
really just to become

836
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,120
the kind of father of the nation
and influence the next generation.

837
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,320
But if you can't do that, then they're
the best things to do is to die young.

838
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,680
So people will, you know,
you were only ever beautiful and perfect

839
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,080
and never disappointing
and middle aged, essentially.

840
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,680
But we'll also will never have enough.

841
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,320
And that's part I think that's part of the
I story, too.

842
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:01,200
That feeling that everything is
impermanent and limited is so emotional

843
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,720
to humans.

844
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,160
So that will be the other hope

845
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,160
that we try to find genius in

846
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,560
experiences with people. Again.

847
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,880
I yeah, it's a two futures.

848
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,040
Are everybody talking to the AI
and forming kind of cults to worship them

849
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,560
as gods or people go to the park
and hang out with their friends like,

850
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,400
you know, or go to, you know,
a concert hall and listen to music again,

851
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,360
that one of those futures seems a lot
more utopian than the other one.

852
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,480
And is there a type of human genius
that could compete with.

853
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,720
Yeah, I when I was like.

854
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,440
Say, oh,

855
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,440
my life took ages to come
and they might be the next five minutes.

856
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,600
But I found that foundation where you were

857
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,600
okay, a good.

858
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,880
My worry.

859
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,080
Human genius.

860
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,320
Yeah.

861
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,320
So, like, where we can find

862
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,840
a different kind of genius
than the tech world, you know?

863
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,840
I mean, I hope so.

864
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,560
I think, yeah.

865
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,000
I don't know about your relationship
with tech.

866
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,040
Mine is quite conflicted.

867
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,240
I I'm still.

868
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,800
I love things that are new
and interesting.

869
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,760
I'm trying to.

870
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,960
I just downloaded

871
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,600
cloud code and thought, nope,
I don't know what any of this stuff.

872
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,400
You know, I never studied computing, but,
you know, being curious and,

873
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,320
interested in new things
I think is is beautiful.

874
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,400
At the same time, I, like most of us,
wish I spent less time on my phone,

875
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,240
less time.

876
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,600
Doomscrolling
you know, drinking from the firehose,

877
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,400
all of these phrases that we have to say
that you just it's odd to be disconnected

878
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,440
from yourself and so much of life
being mediated through a screen.

879
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,200
So, you know, I wouldn't mind seeing
what the next turn of that wheel is.

880
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Yeah, I think, I think, I think

881
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,400
my relationship with tech is,
yeah, I is ambivalent.

882
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,120
I think in the
way that lots of people's is.

883
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,040
Yeah.

884
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,040
I share the ambivalence.

885
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,320
But it's, it's.

886
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:19,600
Yeah.

887
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,640
And I don't know,
in our capitalist society right now,

888
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,640
it's really hard to imagine
other people than this

889
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,720
tech bros becoming, being called geniuses.

890
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,880
You find that as well?

891
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,920
Yeah. I think it's very sad that.

892
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,000
I mean, the book is full of geniuses
who all, you know, people

893
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,720
who have been hailed as geniuses,

894
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,200
who have a really difficult relationship
with making money,

895
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,280
and quite often, again, the person
who ends up being called a genius is

896
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,280
the person who's got the best marketing,
which is really difficult, I think.

897
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,280
Is it trying to separate out
true achievement from somebody

898
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,320
who's best at selling themselves
as a product is often very hard.

899
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,480
So, you know, and artists have had this,

900
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,560
you know,
this struggle for, for centuries, right.

901
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,560
When you in if you're an not in
the Renaissance, you had to find a patron,

902
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,800
which meant that you had to paint

903
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,800
very flattering pictures of a medici
or whoever it might be,

904
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,200
then you end up with the marketplace
and you end up with, you know, people like

905
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,800
Andy Warhol or Jeff Koons making art
that's specifically

906
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,840
about, you know, how much,
how reproducible is this?

907
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,440
How much money can I make out of this?

908
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,280
Damien Hirst art is often
very much in dialog with that idea.

909
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,400
You know, he made a skull entirely covered
with diamonds.

910
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,280
That was about the statement of like,
what is, you know,

911
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,200
what is the most expensive thing I could
do to to a dead object, essentially.

912
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,400
So I think, you know,
these are conversations

913
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,520
have been happening for a long, long time.

914
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,560
The relationship between achievement
and money has always been quite tense.

915
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,600
I think it's particularly tense
now, as you say, with

916
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,440
with what's happening in tech,
because there are, you know, the US stock

917
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,520
market is so dominated
by these big tech companies,

918
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,960
you know, and ones that have only existed
often for, you know, 20 years, say,

919
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,320
you know, we are so kind of

920
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,040
there's so much wealth and investment,

921
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,200
you know, really just going to a handful
of companies in a tiny geographical area

922
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,360
in a way that me to me, feels like
making an extremely dangerously large

923
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,840
bet on a very small number of
if kind of horses.

924
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,200
I'm not sure that much was going to tech
horses.

925
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,480
Tech bro
horses, horses made of tech brains.

926
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,080
But you know what I mean.

927
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,320
Like, I would be I would be more relaxed
about tech if I felt that

928
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,600
there was exciting stuff happening in
lots of other ways, but it makes me

929
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,400
it makes me sad to think that it's hard
now because of things

930
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,360
like Spotify, for example,
to make a living as a mid-level artist,

931
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,280
you know, they're all the superstars,
and then it's become harder

932
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,040
for everybody else at the lower levels.

933
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,400
And I think you probably say the same
about the film industry.

934
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,600
You know, you can make extremely expensive
films or very, very low budget ones,

935
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,520
and the mid-tier is as hollowed out,
television, I think.

936
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,960
Well, now the streaming boom is over.

937
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,600
We might have a similar thing.

938
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,280
The same thing happens in science.

939
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,760
If you win the Nobel, your lab is funded.

940
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,160
Things are great, but actually is research
funding for mid-tier scientists.

941
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,840
Is that now tougher?

942
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,640
You know, people are finding
that more difficult to do.

943
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,960
And that is that is a story about the way
that capitalism has shaped our society,

944
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,760
perhaps into ways
that are more when it takes all,

945
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,520
which is not really healthy.

946
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,680
Like I would prefer to have more people
doing things

947
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,480
that they love and a kind of more
rich ecosystem, rather than a couple

948
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,480
of really tall trees that you know,
whose canopy shades everything else.

949
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,880
And maybe also so that, it

950
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,480
drains the talents of potential geniuses
into one sector.

951
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,960
Does it? Yeah.

952
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,160
Yeah. People with.

953
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,600
Yeah.

954
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,320
Tons of people wanted to finance.

955
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,160
Yeah,

956
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,360
yeah.

957
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,520
There's a line from,

958
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,120
the book Chaos Monkeys by a guy

959
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,440
who used to work for Facebook
as something that essentially I've seen

960
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,600
the best minds of my generation,
you know, training people to click on ads.

961
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,680
Right. And that's just that's.

962
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:01,920
Yeah.

963
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,560
When you think about what Facebook is
as a company, it's an advertising company.

964
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,560
You know, it's
now trying to pivot to be an AI company

965
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,160
because everything, everything is.

966
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,480
But that's not and there's nothing wrong
with advertising per se, but it's not

967
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,000
it doesn't feel as exciting
as building a cathedral

968
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,080
somehow. But,

969
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,200
We spoke to Corey Doctorow.

970
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,640
Yeah.

971
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,800
You know, he says when the company said
they're pivoting, they're being paid.

972
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:35,760
Right.

973
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,560
And that's
definitely the case with Facebook.

974
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,320
They just were like, I don't think
there's anything in this AI business.

975
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:40,680
It's fine.

976
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,880
And then they just,

977
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,880
you know, in the salaries they were trying
to poach people on were extraordinary.

978
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,400
You know, like the people talking about
kind of eight figure salaries.

979
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,240
And again, that's a story
about kind of monopolization,

980
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,080
you know, would it be in a world
in which I write about this

981
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,520
in the book, you know, in 110 years,
brief Facebook, no matter

982
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,320
boom, WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus,
you know, just,

983
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,280
just everything being sucked into this,
into these giant mega corporations again.

984
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,080
Is that the best use of individual
people's talents just to be kind of,

985
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,600
you know, one cog in a giant machine,
I again, I would I'd be more happy

986
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,160
if there was if they were,
if they were more interesting companies.

987
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,240
And you didn't have to just rely on scale.

988
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Maybe that's also the way things.

989
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,440
Appear.

990
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,160
If you understand that Mark Zuckerberg is
maybe also an example of someone

991
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,120
who's actually proven, scaling up
and not really inventing stuff.

992
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,600
He's not an inventor.

993
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,320
His genius is just based on right
companies

994
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,080
at the right time
and, you know, puts them out there.

995
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,400
And then also everybody, starts
using them.

996
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:51,720
Yeah.

997
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,400
His fundamental insight is, shouldn't
I have a website where you can rate

998
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,960
how hot people are?

999
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,840
And, you know, I'm old enough.

1000
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,320
I remember that another website
that that there was

1001
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,640
a more overt version of that
which was called Hot or not.com, but,

1002
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,920
you know, but Mark Zuckerberg is
an interesting example of the genius myth.

1003
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,840
I don't write about him
so much in the book, but the, the film,

1004
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,520
Aaron Sorkin's

1005
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,320
brilliant film Social Network, directed
by David Fincher, is really interesting

1006
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,560
because it makes one very big change
to Mark Zuckerberg's life, which is that

1007
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:26,280
in real life, he started dating Priscilla
Chan, his wife of 20 years, at college.

1008
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,640
By all accounts, you know, very happy.

1009
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,000
They've got three kids together.

1010
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
The book makes him a single loser.

1011
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,880
And that's really interesting to me
that they would think that that story is,

1012
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,680
you know, let's make the creation of this
incredibly big website and social network

1013
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,920
platforming about one guy's quest
to, like, make girls like him.

1014
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,800
And turns out you got a girl to like him.
That was not a problem.

1015
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,560
But it is his.

1016
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,160
Yeah, he was with the same woman that he's
been married to now for a long time

1017
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,600
when he was, you know, during all this,
you know, this is not a guy

1018
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,840
who is driven by his, like, resentment
at not being able to get laid.

1019
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,680
But that was a very powerful genius
myth of the nerd

1020
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,680
loser who gets his revenge on the world.

1021
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,400
And the tagline for that movie is,
you know, you can't get to

1022
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,400
whatever it was a billion friends
without making some enemies.

1023
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,120
So it was all about him
being kind of opposed to the world.

1024
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,240
And if he's just a normal regular guy
with who's not massively tortured,

1025
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,880
it doesn't doesn't really work.

1026
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,000
Of course, the good thing
about Mark Zuckerberg is that with fame,

1027
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,760
he has had a chance to get more weird,
and he's now obsessed with Roman emperors.

1028
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,120
And this guy named all of his daughters
after various Roman emperors.

1029
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,120
And that which is the kind of thing that
I think that's that's what being called

1030
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,040
a genius does to you.

1031
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,120
You go, that's cool.

1032
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,120
My kids after Roman emperors.

1033
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,120
He started off as a stable genius.

1034
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,520
Yeah, very stable genius.

1035
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,280
And, well, I'm,
you know, I but I think that I think

1036
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,840
if you look at biopics, they are really
interesting as a way of understanding

1037
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,840
how genius may get constructed,
because the social network

1038
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,320
both relies on Mark Zuckerberg,
the loser, and Mark Zuckerberg versus

1039
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:08,600
these two in the Winklevoss twins, Blythe,
you know, bastions of privilege.

1040
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,160
These guys who are just from, you know,

1041
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,160
who've just a handsome and tall
and have got everything going for them.

1042
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,960
And he's the nerd and the outsider.

1043
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,960
And for a particular type of guy

1044
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,040
at the time,
that was that was the mythology of tech.

1045
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,840
It was when you were in high school,
there were guys who were the jocks

1046
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,000
and they got all the girls, and they were
really handsome and they played football.

1047
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,200
And you went to computer club
and no one liked you.

1048
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,560
And but guess what?

1049
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,560
Now you're incredibly rich
and you can have anything you want.

1050
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,520
And that's. Essentially films.

1051
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,200
Revenge of the. Nerds, right?

1052
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,000
But that's that.

1053
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,040
That is the kind of mythology
and that's been a very durable mythology,

1054
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,320
despite the fact now that

1055
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,840
there are a lot of extremely rich nerds,
being a nerd is a really great thing.

1056
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:57,080
Like, any parent would be quite happy for
that kid to go to computer club, right?

1057
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:57,960
But that's fine.

1058
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,800
That's not you know, being the jock is not

1059
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,800
this sort of socially
like pinnacle anymore.

1060
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,000
And if you were, I'm going
to try to ask the question one more time.

1061
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,560
Just to
if you could point to one side of it,

1062
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,920
maybe it's poets
and it's people working with dogs,

1063
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:21,200
I don't know, but if you would have like
one type of person that could be annoying

1064
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,640
to the new geniuses
instead of tech world, who would you pick?

1065
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:28,920
We'll see.

1066
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,760
You put your poking my at my actual unease
with the label of genius here,

1067
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,080
which is that, you know,

1068
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,760
I would love to to
I would love to find better ways.

1069
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,960
And I think this is a huge challenge
as a writer

1070
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,960
to talk about the genius of teams
or the genius of organizations.

1071
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,640
And we do have some examples of that.

1072
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,440
People in tech circles will talk to you
endlessly about Bell Labs,

1073
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,720
run by telecommunications company
in the 20th century,

1074
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,360
just to sort of huge
amounts of innovations.

1075
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,880
They will talk to you about what
it's like, how amazing

1076
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,880
it is to work in a creative team
with other people.

1077
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,160
And, you know my background,
I'm a journalist.

1078
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,560
I have been so happy throughout my career
to work in incredible teams,

1079
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,160
because you can always achieve more
together than you can just as one person.

1080
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,160
You need people to sparkle.

1081
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:19,360
Yeah.

1082
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,360
And I've always throughout
my career had editors who have said,

1083
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,120
this goes on a bit long.
Could you make this shorter?

1084
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,760
I don't understand what you're saying
here.

1085
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,800
You know, that kind of that kind of input
is great, but also lots of,

1086
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,280
creativity happens in pairs.

1087
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,560
I'm just about to go and talk about
John and Paul, the Beatles,

1088
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,160
you know, two incredible songwriters,
but together just,

1089
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
a force much great
an who could have been on their own.

1090
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,280
And we've got a little bit better
at telling those stories, but

1091
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,040
I think instead of us trying to find
a new archetype of genius, I'd probably

1092
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,640
be happier if we could broaden out
the ways that we talk about achievement,

1093
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,640
to talk about the genius of groups
and teams.

1094
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,200
I mean, and as I'm saying that it sounds
phenomenally boring.

1095
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,840
It's going to be quite the challenge.

1096
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,440
I'm not sure. Maybe it could be done.

1097
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,280
I think it's a different way
of telling a story that's the problem is

1098
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,880
we we're so used to the other story. Yeah.

1099
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:15,600
Yeah.

1100
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,600
And so
it's a it will take experimentation.

1101
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,080
But we've been used to the other story
since, you know, Norse mythology and,

1102
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,360
you know, Beowulf and Roman
and Greek mythology.

1103
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,560
So I think that more might just appeal
to human brains more.

1104
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,080
I think we might have to concede
that point.

1105
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,800
Yeah.

1106
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,800
My kids
keep asking me to tell stories about

1107
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,920
singular heroes doing stuff.

1108
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,160
Yeah.

1109
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,160
They don't want to ever hear
about Bell Labs.

1110
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,640
I don't see many children's books
among the great teams.

1111
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,480
Well, yeah.

1112
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,000
I haven't felt like, the

1113
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
a bit.

1114
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,200
They have those books.

1115
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,160
Now there's the only good books, right?

1116
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:56,920
Yeah, yeah.

1117
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,600
Oh, yeah. They're like little people.
Big dreams. Yeah. And then they'll.

1118
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,120
And then you have to perseverance
and then, you know, and everybody

1119
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,000
super enthused all that kind of stuff.

1120
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,080
But they're always
just you feel that there's a meaning.

1121
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,720
There's like some.

1122
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,120
Oh that they're teaching you. Yeah.

1123
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,800
Put into the book.

1124
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,880
And you somehow,

1125
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,880
you don't feel that, if you read like,

1126
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,880
the children's version
that you want to see yourself.

1127
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,280
Yeah. People are. Actually.

1128
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:31,320
Oh, this is a this is actually
a great leader of this team as well.

1129
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,440
You it what we also as a team.

1130
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,520
It's very 18th century.

1131
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,080
The 18th century had a craze
what they called, conduct books,

1132
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,920
moralizing literature like by Hannah Moore
was one of the biggest selling books.

1133
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,920
And they were essentially kind
of instructional texts.

1134
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,120
And we've given kids a version of that
now where we give them books about,

1135
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,080
you know, about people who've overcome
great obstacles in this very heavily

1136
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,640
didactic way,

1137
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,680
which is fascinating,
because the one thing that children love

1138
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:03,160
more than anything is stories
about like, people farting or the road

1139
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,720
doll stories, which are all about people
being naughty, breaking the law,

1140
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,480
poisoning their grandmother.

1141
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,920
You know, all these things
that are kind of decadent.

1142
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,720
But, one thing I was fascinated by
when I was researching Thomas

1143
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:19,600
Edison is the fact that he is now
a genius for American children.

1144
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,240
And I read about the fact that almost
no one visits the museum in Menlo

1145
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,840
Park, his laboratory, and someone I know
wrote to me saying, yeah, I went to it.

1146
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,080
I went to to it,
and it was the way to go and it was empty.

1147
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,600
And so he has become a kind of

1148
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,360
children's story essentially about.

1149
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,560
And the way that it's raised with him
is that, you know, the 99% perspiration,

1150
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,760
1% inspiration,
the idea that you just got to work hard.

1151
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,280
So he, you know, his his genius
myth has now moved from American

1152
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,680
Prometheus to kind of grind set you know,
you've just got to get up in the morning

1153
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,680
and try 100 things,
and one of them all will work.

1154
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,600
The great sadness, actually, you should.

1155
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,400
Maybe that's like a

1156
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,680
it will be like a shift from the
the genius

1157
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,560
in our culture.

1158
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,560
Maybe we're slowly shifting towards.

1159
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,280
Yeah. You don't you think I.

1160
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,120
Was the driver. Yeah.
Which is probably healthier, right.

1161
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,320
Because everybody could probably stand
to try a little bit harder.

1162
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,200
But what you can't do
is be a savant, right?

1163
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,000
You're just not born playing the piano

1164
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,160
at the level
that Mozart could when he was five.

1165
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,360
But you could, you know, you could try it.

1166
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,880
You could find something
that you enjoy doing,

1167
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,080
you think you're good at
and try really hard at it.

1168
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:35,240
But that is interesting about though
we though we, we fetishize

1169
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,120
the kind of lightning bulb moment,
you know, the strike of inspiration.

1170
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,600
You will often find many,
many people who achieve great things

1171
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,600
who just grind away
that they work really hard. But,

1172
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,280
and David

1173
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,720
Gunnarsson has this idea
of two different types of innovator

1174
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,000
or genius, which is the kind of the kind
of which he is.

1175
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,080
He references Picasso and Suzanne

1176
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,880
Picasso has this idea. Cubism, right?

1177
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,840
What if painting.

1178
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,120
But I'll make it look a bit like blocks

1179
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,000
where Suzanne works and works away
at the same subject.

1180
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,640
He will have paints the same things.

1181
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,640
He's just trying to make the best version
of this

1182
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,680
ideal version of a painting
that's in his head,

1183
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,000
and that's you know, and you can see
the difference between those two types

1184
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,440
of, of genius,
even in how much their art costs.

1185
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,120
You know, with with Picasso,
people want to buy the Cubist work.

1186
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,560
They want to buy the art.

1187
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:35,240
The idea with Suzanne, the value persists

1188
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:39,200
until his much later work
because it's about iteration.

1189
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,120
It's about doing the same thing.
It's about perfecting.

1190
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,200
And I think that that is two fundamentally
different ideas about genius.

1191
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,160
Is it the Big bang or is it the
somebody who has a kind of life's work

1192
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,680
and an a perfect image in their head?
They're working towards,

1193
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,640
Thank you.

1194
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:56,960
It's that.

1195
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,160
If I, I warn you, I.

1196
00:57:59,160 --> 00:57:59,520
Don't know,

1197
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,480
but I, part of what I would like to do
is also talk about some of these,

1198
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,320
times.

1199
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:06,600
Yeah.

1200
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,600
Other, other types of

1201
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,120
will find themselves geniuses.

1202
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,880
But I think I would like to do that.

1203
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,880
Stand. Sure.

1204
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,600
Yeah.

1205
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,760
You thought they were part of.

1206
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,000
I really didn't talk talking.

1207
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,560
That's pretty funny,

1208
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:48,840
I did.

1209
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,680
I think this this overcoat,
I think is peak romantic genius, isn't it?

1210
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,280
The kind of great coat that if you've just
kind of leapt off your horse

1211
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,280
to be part of your grand
tour across Europe?

1212
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,240
It's very.

1213
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,320
It's a really,

1214
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,920
like a German romantic long it is.

1215
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,560
It really is.

1216
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,560
Like he's just gone
to the kind of ruined gothic castle

1217
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,000
in which he's about to meet a flighty
young woman in a night dress.

1218
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:25,960
Hard to imagine.

1219
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,280
Donald Trump is an 18th century
romantic genius.

1220
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,240
I would say

1221
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,240
writing poetry.

1222
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,280
Maybe you could,

1223
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,400
start going by some of them and then.

1224
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,120
Okay.

1225
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,200
Pick one
and you can take them off another.

1226
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,240
Maybe.

1227
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,480
I thought there's some of these
kind of labels, right, that you have.

1228
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,480
Like you, you say, some people are,

1229
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,880
Like, millennial boy child.

1230
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,320
What can I say?

1231
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,160
Yeah. Okay. What's that?

1232
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,160
Come behind.

1233
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,320
So, I'm a big fan of 18th century.

1234
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,960
Ellen.

1235
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,600
I'm not sure what he is
supposed to have done immediately

1236
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,640
before this portrait, but,
I guess he looks a bit like he's,

1237
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,080
I don't know, sailed down the Danube
or something

1238
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:22,080
in an attempt
to write his great work about.

1239
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,920
Yeah, I don't know, mathematics
or something like that.

1240
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,880
That would be very kind
of 18th century thing to do.

1241
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,120
Van Gogh looks,

1242
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:30,840
brilliant in this.

1243
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,520
I think one of things
that's fascinating about Van

1244
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,080
Gogh from portraits
is that he's managed to get his.

1245
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,320
He managed to mythologize his own hair.

1246
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,960
You always see Van Gogh hair like that.

1247
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,480
And I think he did a really good job of
of making the case that he had great hair.

1248
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,360
Donald Trump, I struggle to say,
is a 19th century romantic genius.

1249
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:52,160
I don't think he seems enormously tortured
about anything at all.

1250
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,640
He's a kind of exemplar, I guess.

1251
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,600
I'm a very 1980s kind of genius,
which is just the kind of bullying

1252
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:02,640
salesman, that was a very popular
kind of 80s archetype.

1253
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,440
And then. Yeah.

1254
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,160
Mark Zuckerberg had looks every bit
the kind of,

1255
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,320
I don't know, whatever the 18th century
equivalent is of the millennial boy king

1256
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,600
supposedly had been born in.

1257
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,920
I guess if he was born in like 1783,
he would have just been around for,

1258
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,400
the American, the, the aftermath,
the American Revolution.

1259
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,560
He could have been a young American
or over to Europe on his grand tour.

1260
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,720
But, you know, this is what's interesting
about this to me is the fact that you can

1261
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,120
you can see so many of the tropes of,

1262
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,840
of heroic portraiture and all of these.

1263
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:38,760
Right, which is the kind of noble gaze
off into the distance is if you're having

1264
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,920
a particularly big thought,

1265
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,720
you know, the kind of the tempestuous
landscape behind you that reflect your,

1266
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,320
your personal feelings,
which is the pathetic fallacy.

1267
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,040
And there's there's torment.

1268
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,560
There's too many. Eyes.
And in the landscape.

1269
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,280
I'm not sure there's torment
in, Donald Trump's eyes.

1270
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,560
He looks like he's going to buy that ship
and possibly knock down

1271
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,080
this Roman forum and, like,
turn it into the Trump branded forum.

1272
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,480
But the rest of them, certainly.

1273
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,440
Yes, I think so.

1274
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,760
If you have some of these archetypes,
like the tortured rebel, the millennial

1275
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,800
boy King, you have a bunch of these
kind of like archetypes in the book.

1276
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,640
What if you start on the right

1277
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,480
when you can pick up the painting
if you want, but maybe just say,

1278
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,640
what kind of genius
are we looking at here?

1279
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:25,600
So Elon Musk, I would say,
is the archetype of the kind of tech bro

1280
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,800
who is too busy
and important to be nice to you.

1281
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,880
And this is kind of a fascinating thing,
I think, which is that

1282
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,240
the fact
that you really essentially the rudeness

1283
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,720
or the lack of interpersonal skills
is rewritten as evidence of greatness.

1284
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,800
You know, he simply is too busy having
big thoughts about rockets to answer.

1285
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,280
Well, to send anything other than
like a poop emoji back to you in emails.

1286
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,360
Vincent van Gogh, to me,
is the archetype of the tortured genius

1287
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,400
that a lot of that mythology is fair
in the sense that he struggled all

1288
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,640
his life with mental illness.

1289
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,720
You know, he

1290
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,640
he killed himself at the age of 37,
having sold only a single painting.

1291
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,520
This painting, I've have to say,
this is not a.

1292
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,560
This is not a Mankoff. Painting.

1293
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:11,200
He would you do made that landscape
much meaner and darker.

1294
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,600
But you know, his sister in law, Jo Van
Goff, Bangor.

1295
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,440
She, lived in this boarding house.

1296
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,360
I think he was in Utrecht, actually,
which was just entirely covered

1297
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:26,000
in every single, pretty much
every single extant piece of and of art.

1298
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:30,720
They had, almond blossom above the
fireplace in the, in the baby's bedroom.

1299
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,840
And she did an enormous service to him
by publishing Van Gogh's,

1300
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,720
letters to his brother Theo,
which were all about his struggle,

1301
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,840
his inability to sell anything, his need
for money, his mental health struggles.

1302
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:47,400
And that created this incredibly powerful
mythology of the struggling artist,

1303
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:52,200
which was so important to, you know,
how people now interpret the paintings.

1304
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,760
You would say.

1305
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,400
He would say she, his sister in law,
actually made him, she went to Jeannie.

1306
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,720
She made him famous. She made him famous.

1307
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,720
She did all the things
that you really need someone to do.

1308
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,000
You know, if you are a dead genius.

1309
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,680
Which is? She looked after the archive.

1310
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,360
She didn't sell off the paintings
too quickly.

1311
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,920
She tried to place them in museums.

1312
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,680
She created a market for them,

1313
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,600
and she created this
really powerful mythology around them.

1314
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,400
You know, these were beautiful,

1315
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,000
but twisted paintings from a beautiful
but twisted mind.

1316
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,280
And ever since,

1317
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,280
that has just the thing that has affected
the way that we read Bank of paintings.

1318
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,160
You don't look at Van Gogh paintings
and think of them often.

1319
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,440
The emotion you get from
them is happiness, and that is that.

1320
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,040
Is that right, or is that you reading them
through his biography?

1321
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,160
If you look at the irises and, you know,
if you didn't know anything about Van

1322
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,400
Gogh, you might think that's
a really happy, colorful painting.

1323
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,400
And so a temptation is always to read
the painting through the tortured genius.

1324
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,200
Donald Trump is the

1325
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,560
is I going to say, the political genius,
the very stable genius?

1326
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,320
He certainly thinks he's a genius.

1327
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,760
I mean, the the case for Donald Trump,
not something you hear that

1328
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:07,600
much in Europe these days is that he is
a singular historical figure.

1329
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,040
He has an analysis of what you know

1330
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,120
is wrong with America
and how to make America great again.

1331
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,880
And he's managed to get people
to come along with that, that vision,

1332
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,120
you know,
and I think probably this is going to send

1333
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:20,840
some of these things, people

1334
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,600
gonna laugh at me for saying,
I think people will probably see him

1335
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,240
on the level of importance of a
of a Napoleon.

1336
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,080
That's the that's the
of all the people I could compare them to.

1337
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,560
That's maybe the most flattering,

1338
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,600
but in the sense
that American history is different

1339
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,720
because he existed in a way that you can't
always say about political leaders.

1340
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:39,680
And finally, Mark

1341
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,680
Zuckerberg, the millennial boy king.

1342
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,160
He's about my age.

1343
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,160
So, yeah, yeah, I was think.

1344
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,360
I was sort of feel a bit. Like,
how's he doing?

1345
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,200
How rich is he now?

1346
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,080
How much better is his life
going than mine?

1347
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,640
Oh, good. Still, still very rich.

1348
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,080
Is that part of the mythology
like the comparison with us mere mortals?

1349
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,280
I think for people who get very famous
and successful, very young,

1350
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:06,280
it is because you think, hang on a minute,
you're 23 and you've done this.

1351
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,120
And that becomes another element of the
the kind of superhuman nature of

1352
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,200
what's happening
is it's impressive to build a website

1353
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,520
that is worth $1 billion.

1354
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,840
It's even more impressive to do it
when you're 20,

1355
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,840
you know,
when you just dropped out of Harvard.

1356
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,280
And for a long time. Yeah.

1357
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,520
Mark Zuckerberg's youth was kind of,
you know, it was the thing that he would

1358
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,720
wear the Adidas slides,
he wore tracksuit bottoms.

1359
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:30,720
He didn't wear a suit.

1360
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,480
You know,
there was very much that he remade that

1361
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,400
Silicon Valley mythology
of the kind of the casual ness of it.

1362
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,160
You know, this is not buttoned up
establishment.

1363
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,680
These guys are young and hip and cool.

1364
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,080
Of course, you know,
lots of them are now in the 40s and 50s.

1365
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,240
It's quite it's harder.

1366
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,760
So he's had his reinvention now as a kind
of jujitsu bro with his gold chain.

1367
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,440
And talking about how he doesn't
drink caffeine.

1368
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:57,440
But again, that isn't that is
a very Silicon Valley archetype, right?

1369
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,680
Doing the martial arts,
talking about being masculine again, he's,

1370
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,120
you know, he he's not immune to fashion,
even though you think

1371
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,760
one of the best things
about being a billionaire

1372
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,560
is that you don't have to follow fashion,
but people people still do it.

1373
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,200
He was the black T-shirt guy, right?

1374
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,000
Yeah, exactly.

1375
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
He just had, like,
loads and loads of the same outfit.

1376
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,520
And again,
this was part of his genius mythology.

1377
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:21,800
He was simply too busy and important
to think about

1378
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,280
wearing different types of clothing.

1379
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,560
He just wore the same thing every day.

1380
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,880
And that was one less decision,
because he just got to save his brain

1381
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,400
for making the really big decisions.

1382
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,320
You have your eye line.

1383
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,840
Yeah, yeah, I think a few.

1384
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,000
Sorry.

1385
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,560
Is there nothing else
to say about any of them?

1386
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,800
I think that's maybe it.

1387
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,760
Yeah, maybe.

1388
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,040
Because maybe you can take his picture.

1389
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,560
Tell me a little bit more. About what?

1390
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,560
What what a millennial working

1391
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,600
and feels. What?

1392
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,400
It's just a nightmare.

1393
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,760
Maybe you want to put a different
label on him. That's also fine.

1394
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,560
No, no, I think.

1395
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,000
I think he's I think what Mark Zuckerberg
is a millennial boy king

1396
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,200
because he symbolizes, I think for people,

1397
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,520
the irresponsibility of Silicon Valley.

1398
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,640
And that's more forgivable when you're
young than when you're in your 40s.

1399
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,640
So, you know, when you know, the, the,

1400
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,880
that kind of idea of the Silicon Valley
motto of move fast and break things

1401
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,200
essentially is a bit more forgivable
in somebody who is young.

1402
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,600
Because, you know, that's what
that's what young people do.

1403
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:21,960
Sorry.

1404
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,960
I'm staring off into the middle distance
where I'm trying to connect my thoughts.

1405
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,960
It's very hard
to think and talk at the same time.

1406
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,360
It turns out,

1407
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,160
It turns clear to him.

1408
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,680
Yeah. I mean, you.

1409
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:31,800
Yeah.

1410
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,720
No, no, no, it just made me.

1411
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,640
Yeah. Okay.

1412
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,560
It looks like you are talking
to someone there.

1413
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,560
Okay.

1414
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,880
Yeah, I think I think Millennial Boy
King is the epithet

1415
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,720
that gets applied to him
because he symbolized what was new in the

1416
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:52,920
2000 and young, in the sense that this was
a time when everything was changing.

1417
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,120
People had huge hopes for Facebook
and what it might accomplish

1418
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:57,320
during that time when,

1419
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,920
you know
it was going to bring down governments

1420
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,560
and of course, the Arab Spring
and all that kind of stuff.

1421
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,800
So I think his his youth at the time
was a really big part of that mythology.

1422
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,560
And it's maybe why there's been a certain
level of discomfort from him

1423
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,440
as he's got older. He's now in his 40s.

1424
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,120
What's the mythology now? What?

1425
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,920
You know, when you were an aged
boy king, when you're just a king,

1426
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,080
that's not quite as cool anymore?

1427
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,480
Or somehow, is it?

1428
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,640
It's not a myth.

1429
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,480
It's not a myth.

1430
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,520
It's not all
those different types of king.

1431
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,600
You can become the Henry
the Eighth, you know, you can become.

1432
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,120
The old, fat, bloated. King.

1433
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,600
But I don't think he's, He's very keen
not to do that. I would say,

1434
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,440
I think can go with

1435
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,680
maybe a little bit more of a
could you take Elon Musk all right.

1436
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:37,600
Yeah.

1437
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,080
Because I think we talked about him
also in the interview quite long.

1438
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,080
So sure.

1439
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,040
Jordan, with the way.

1440
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,000
You know, Musk appears in the book.

1441
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,720
Quite a lot.

1442
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,840
Because he is somebody that people love
to argue about on the internet.

1443
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,760
And he's also somebody

1444
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:57,480
I have these very conflicted feelings
about him, too, which is that

1445
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:01,360
he has undoubtedly created
incredibly interesting companies that,

1446
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,000
you know, have changed things.

1447
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,840
I would say Tesla has done
an incredible job of making electric

1448
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,600
cars cool and sexy,
rather than a kind of hair shirt.

1449
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,920
You know, you have to have an electric car

1450
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,680
because otherwise the seals will be upset.

1451
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,880
No, you want an electric car? It's cool.

1452
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:20,040
And that he did that,
with Tesla, with Space-X.

1453
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:23,840
You know, NASA was obviously an incredibly

1454
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,880
important and influential organization
in the 20th century.

1455
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,120
It had subcontractors
who were seen widely to be quite.

1456
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,640
Slow. And expensive.

1457
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,880
And he said, I wonder
if we can be much faster and much cheaper,

1458
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:39,280
you know, if we're going to do this thing,
maybe let's have reusable rockets.

1459
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,280
Let's try and make all the parts as simple
as they possibly can,

1460
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,800
as cheap as they possibly can.

1461
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,640
And then we're much more likely to get to,
you know, the Mars or the moon.

1462
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,640
And let's not take away
from the achievement.

1463
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,320
You know, they have put astronauts

1464
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:55,720
living humans into space in rockets
built by Elon Musk Company.

1465
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,600
That is an engineering
feat until, you know,

1466
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,200
until Elon Musk came along, that was a
thing that only states could do.

1467
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,280
And now private company can do that too.

1468
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,920
So I don't you know.

1469
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,200
You've seen that one of those.

1470
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,240
I did I did.

1471
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,240
I went to
Florida and I went to Cape Canaveral.

1472
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,520
And I saw everybody
heading for the back of the bay.

1473
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,520
So I had no idea what was going on.

1474
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,160
And I just so happened that I got there

1475
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,520
at the same time
that they were doing a rocket launch.

1476
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,880
And it is exactly as awe inspiring
and moving as you would expect it to be.

1477
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,680
You will sit on the lawn
and they have the camp dome,

1478
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:29,400
which you've seen in a million films
already, and then just this tiny little

1479
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,880
speck of bright orange
appears in the blue blue sky.

1480
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:36,120
And that is, you know, in that case,
that was a cargo payload.

1481
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,120
But that's still that stuff
leaving the Earth.

1482
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,120
You know, something that if you said
that to a human 2000 years ago

1483
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,520
would have sounded like something that
was, you know, only God could have done.

1484
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,920
And we can now do it.

1485
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,400
And, you know, I did find that I did find
that quite inspiring and moving.

1486
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,800
What was it, a moment of genius.

1487
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:57,120
It it it was a
it was certainly a connection

1488
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,080
with something that felt superhuman,
which is pretty good definition of genius.

1489
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,360
The problem is you go from that.

1490
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,920
And my second thought after thinking

1491
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,480
this is so inspiring was
why are you on Twitter all day?

1492
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,280
You know,
what are you doing with your life?

1493
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,280
You can do this.

1494
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,720
Why are you arguing with people
on the internet about conspiracy theories

1495
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,960
and like replying lol based.

1496
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,880
To someone's like meme of a frog.

1497
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,080
And I think that's, you know, that's.

1498
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,800
Why we love to argue about Elon Musk
is there's two sides of him.

1499
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,800
There's the absolute prick side of him,

1500
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:32,080
and there is the side that has done
things that are exceptional.

1501
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:37,080
And as I say in the case of the Rocket,
is absolutely awe inspiring, I think.

1502
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,720
So the category that he would fall into
would be like.

1503
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,080
Oh, I think it's probably a category
all of his own.

1504
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,040
I mean. The asshole genius or like.

1505
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,520
Yeah, definitely
the brilliant asshole. Definitely.

1506
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,240
But also like the cooked brain genius,
I think as well.

1507
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,080
That's the other thing.

1508
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,440
I think he had this incredible brain,

1509
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,880
but I just wonder if he's just

1510
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,880
in a way I couldn't live with it,
you know?

1511
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:04,920
Susie Wiles is the Trump's chief of staff,
talked about his his ketamine use.

1512
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,320
You know,

1513
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,800
I just wonder whether or not he has
a, a brain that runs very hot

1514
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:14,000
and therefore has been kind of impossible
to to live with, you know, as a child

1515
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,200
used to apparently not speak
for quite a long time.

1516
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,200
He was very badly
bullied as a child, broke

1517
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,640
his nose being pushed down the stairs.

1518
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,080
And also grew up in.

1519
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,080
Apartheid South.

1520
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:26,880
Africa, which I think is,
you know, it's very difficult to

1521
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:28,600
when you read some of the stuff

1522
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:31,600
that he writes now about race
and intelligence, for example,

1523
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,520
you have to remember that
he grew up in a society

1524
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,520
that was institutionally, legally racist.

1525
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,560
And then the history of race and genius
is a really unpleasant

1526
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,840
and uncomfortable one.

1527
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,080
And, I'm not surprised that people
who are obsessed with

1528
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,240
genius also get obsessed with race
and with with breeding.

1529
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:53,040
I mean, the man's got 14 children
that we know of.

1530
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,880
Probably quite happy to have several more.

1531
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,520
And that's, again, something that afflicts
people who get called a genius.

1532
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:04,560
They think I must pass on my genius genes,
and that doesn't really exist

1533
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,280
as a concept.

1534
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,440
You know, I'm
sure his kids will be smart, mostly,

1535
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,680
but there's a concept
called reversion to the mean,

1536
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,680
which means that whatever
exceptional range of attributes he had,

1537
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,880
any kids of his
will be much closer back to normal.

1538
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,480
And again, that. Can be a real that can.

1539
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,920
Be really upsetting for geniuses.

1540
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,120
They assume that they'll have like

1541
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:25,120
a little brood of kind of tiny prodigies,
and they get nice, normal kids.

1542
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,880
That anyone else will be very happy. With.

1543
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,320
But to them, it's kind of disappointing

1544
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,320
because I thought they were going
to found a kind of great lineage.

1545
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,400
You hold this for a second and.

1546
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,320
It has the exact benefits.

1547
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,520
Now that really like in the book
where you compare

1548
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:44,000
the names of his kids with the names,
I mean, Bahamas.

1549
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,280
Marie,
I think about Emily. Ben quite a lot.

1550
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,840
Just normal people, not Roman.

1551
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,840
Look who Romulus.

1552
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:57,960
And, I that's one more question.

1553
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,960
If you're you're still popular
when you read them

1554
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,680
for the new.

1555
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,640
Volume.

1556
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,560
A bunch more just shows without talking.

1557
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,640
After the show.

1558
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,280
Okay, okay.

1559
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,280
And that one more so.

1560
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:22,840
Yeah.

1561
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,840
Just like in the same scene,
I was thinking,

1562
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,840
I just yesterday
I just read somebody saying, like, it

1563
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,680
was sort of being a little bit you

1564
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,680
at Ellen online and telling him,

1565
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,840
why don't you ever post
pictures of nice landscapes

1566
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,960
you've seen or beautiful stuff
you've done with your family?

1567
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,560
I know, I know, he did a very sad post,
which was like

1568
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,240
something like, people tell you
that being rich won't make you happy.

1569
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,560
Like, and it was like, I'm proof of that.

1570
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,760
And I do think it's sort of essential

1571
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,360
tragedy in

1572
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,360
life is to be given
everything that you want.

1573
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,680
And I think that is his tragedy.

1574
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:01,800
You know,

1575
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:05,360
he obviously had enormously burning
ambition to be a world historical figure.

1576
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,400
And again, it's a kind of genius myth
that you well done.

1577
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,960
Your a world historical figure, but I

1578
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,960
but quite a lot of people hate you
and you can't handle it.

1579
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:16,320
You know, it was very sad reading the
the emails

1580
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,680
in the Epstein files about him,
where he's trying to go to the island

1581
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,440
and they go, oh, sorry, no,
we won't be there.

1582
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:26,240
And, you know, just to be so successful
and then but

1583
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:30,760
but to still be desperate for people to
like you, I think is kind of fascinating.

1584
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,800
But it is it is a classic genius myth.

1585
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,560
And what you get is, is talent,
power, success.

1586
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,560
What you don't get is the one thing
that you want, which is respect.

1587
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,040
So there's there's a price
of your greatness essentially.

1588
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,680
And that price is being happy,

1589
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,800
which is the one of
maybe one of the most fundamental genius.

1590
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,080
Missable.

1591
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,840
And you're looking forward to his biopic,

1592
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,240
I hope.

1593
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,600
I see I feel like Mads
Mikkelsen would play a good, a good Elan.

1594
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,640
But yeah, his biopic would be interesting
because

1595
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,280
you can see there's
two versions of it, right?

1596
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,280
There's the Elan produced and funded
version of it, which is about one,

1597
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,000
you know,

1598
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,400
child's struggle to overcome their violent
upbringing and make it in America.

1599
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:13,040
And there's the other version,
which is the one

1600
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,960
talented man driven mad by the internet.

1601
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,760
You know, you can have the rise
or you can have the fall.

1602
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,760
So I don't know
which version of the biopic will get.

1603
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,760
Maybe a two piece.

1604
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,800
Yeah, maybe they like the Beatles.

1605
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,840
Well, maybe they can make one person.
Who likes Elon Musk can.

1606
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,200
Make one biopic
and but that's that, you know.

1607
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,320
That reflects what I write in the book
about the concept of.

1608
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,080
Biopics is they're mythmaking.

1609
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,920
So you can make the myth of my triumph

1610
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,360
over adversity out of the Elon story,
or you can make it mine.

1611
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,520
Decline and fall.

1612
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,880
How I went mad. The Elon story.

1613
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,200
And both of those are.

1614
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,080
True to the same degree.

1615
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,640
Those are both true about the same person,
but which one you pick to tell

1616
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,680
says an enormous amount about you
and how you regard success.

1617
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:53,520
Really.

1618
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,920
So that's you know, that's what the genius
myth always is about.

1619
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,600
It's about what things do you value?

1620
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,280
Do you value
somebody who strove and overcame,

1621
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:03,480
or do you value somebody who's a nice
human being, an individual?

1622
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,320
How you go back, you go.

1623
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,280
Elon, back. On the.

1624
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,280
Mantelpiece where you deserve.

1625
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,760
No, if it's okay,
just a few shots of you watching

1626
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,760
and just throwing things.

1627
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:38,720
Be discovered.

1628
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,720
Explosion victims.

1629
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,000
And we have no

1630
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
okay, brothers.

1631
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,600
That's the stable genius, right?

1632
01:22:54,600 --> 01:23:07,640
As I say, we're doing a serious. Of.

1633
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,120
The my millennial boy came

1634
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,520
there is.

1635
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,520
When I pedestal and I've been on.

1636
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,160
Is that actually a safe place
to end up a pedestal?

1637
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:35,160
Well, it's kind of like that
being put in them all, isn't it?

1638
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,640
You know,

1639
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,040
someone to look up to,
someone to, to admire.

1640
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,960
But also when someone's up on a pedestal,

1641
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,920
you can see the for you to for me to say
that is the problem.

1642
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,920
The pedestal.

1643
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:57,440
I. Keep thinking if I were going
to find to be what instrument

1644
01:23:58,760 --> 01:23:59,960
for quite like

1645
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:03,920
you know on drums went off on bass,
let's sing.

1646
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,560
And obviously otherwise make a fuss.

1647
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,000
When I make a Tom Hanks at the back.

1648
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
The greatest supergroup we never had.

1649
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,720
To wonder what John would play.

1650
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:19,840
For probably for different genres,
we do have an issue.

1651
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,520
I think if you're going to be genius,
you have to you have to really in March

1652
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,520
to be very drunk, which is not that you,
when you're in a band.

1653
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,360
The two of them were.

1654
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,880
In a kind of a band for a little bit.
Right.

1655
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,840
Know when Trump.

1656
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,240
Oh, so you say you know Mark Zuckerberg.

1657
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:43,760
Yeah. Well yes.

1658
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:48,240
Yes I mean again
the story of genius being one of ego.

1659
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,480
It's not a massive surprise to me
that deluge.

1660
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,120
The Department
for Governmental Efficiency.

1661
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,720
Didn't, didn't work out.
Maybe I should put the next to.

1662
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,680
Maybe I should just
go next. Which are actually,

1663
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,720
it's the two halves of the American whole.

1664
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,800
The American dream.

1665
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,520
And I.

1666
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,280
Together.

1667
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:09,280
Although I think I think they have them
made it out, but,

1668
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,440
Yeah, I think it was very hard
for everybody in the white House.

1669
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,400
To work with.

1670
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,520
You know, Musk.

1671
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,280
Jones chief of staff, describes
him as a, an old, old doc.

1672
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,560
But then many geniuses are,
which I thought was very kind.

1673
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,560
Description.

1674
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:30,720
Who's not to something your.

1675
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:36,840
I they say

1676
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:41,400
if we did all of this on this style,
we could do the show.

1677
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,400
So the the movements will show up.

1678
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:45,840
You could tell if you had.

1679
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,240
A favorite, go painting.

1680
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:52,880
I, I recently
listened to a long podcast about his life.

1681
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,920
It was actually quite interesting.

1682
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,480
Yeah, I like the one with,

1683
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,880
the little cafe, and, I think that's cool.

1684
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,640
Yeah,

1685
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:06,800
that's one of the latest ones
I heard that was.

1686
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:10,840
Like I said, what I like,
I think, and blossom is my favorite.

1687
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,480
It's very simple.

1688
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,040
And I like the irises.

1689
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,120
His flower paintings are wonderful
because I managed to not be

1690
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,960
kind of twee and static
and whatever it might be, but, it's

1691
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,160
one of paintings in the National Gallery
I thought, I love so much.

1692
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:29,160
I thought The Prince of Action
and that he's a tree.

1693
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,360
I am all right this time.

1694
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,760
Actually, I did a cross stitch.

1695
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:36,960
I did an embroidery version of,
sunflowers, which is now my participation.

1696
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,120
And let me tell you,
some of the different colors, the others.

1697
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,080
You said is here.

1698
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,560
But don't you think you said
this here was like a straight line, right?

1699
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,200
When you do that?

1700
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,680
And so I can do this red here.

1701
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,600
But his brushstrokes
are so much a part of.

1702
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:51,600
My gosh.

1703
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,560
I, every time he paints his hair,
he always makes it look absolutely amazing

1704
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:59,800
with this kind of like, sort of mousse
texture and nice and volume and movement.

1705
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,800
And I always say
you could achieve it like that.

1706
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,800
Or did you know your you your print

1707
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:08,160
like painting technique to your hair?

1708
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,920
And that's why I just always look so good.

1709
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:11,880
Okay.

1710
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:15,040
Okay. So.

1711
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
It's just a little okay.

1712
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:22,400
Okay.

1713
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,400
Different.

1714
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,360
And then we can go to the.

1715
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,000
Okay.

1716
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,360
I feel like you should have a bigger,
more gold frame for the other ones, right?

1717
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:37,480
Because I think at the same time,
a frame, especially for Donald Trump is,

1718
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,560
not a particularly ornate frame.

1719
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,440
But sometimes. I have something.

1720
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:45,440
Which is a name of at my house.

1721
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,120
My boss.

1722
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:55,560
But it's into your available tech,
and I don't know, I was first.

1723
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,040
Introduced him to my boss's.

1724
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,160
Do you not? My new chandelier.

1725
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,680
It's just my loves.

1726
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,680
Interior decoration. What can we say?

1727
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:07,600
Yeah, there's a lot of those pictures
going on, so I.

1728
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,680
Yeah, we do a close up with our hands.

1729
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:15,200
Just.

1730
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,720
I don't really look like them.

1731
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,720
It's like new Victoria's.

1732
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,560
Yeah, exactly.

1733
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,400
Yes. It's a very general kind of.

1734
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,840
But it's also the chin is more

1735
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,560
so more like a movie star.

1736
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,560
Yeah. Some subtle surgery.

1737
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:35,400
This with all these models that been
trained on too many photo models.

1738
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,120
Yeah.

1739
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,120
Pretty.

1740
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,280
Scary what you said

1741
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:53,960
about how we might go to the doctor.

1742
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:57,040
The Iron. Man. Is this. Yes.

1743
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:58,680
There we are.

1744
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,680
I just read the New Yorker for that.

1745
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:15,920
I got it in the other room.

1746
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,000
I never really know if it's like,

1747
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,120
the kind of the mythology and,
like the business model.

1748
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,120
It's part of saying how scared it is,

1749
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:28,560
I think.

1750
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,960
So I think that not happening
is going to kill us all.

1751
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:35,280
Was essentially, we need to be not to do
whatever we want to do, you know, just

1752
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:41,160
and I think some of that was definitely
part of the kind of musk of war, right?

1753
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:41,720
Yeah.

1754
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,600
I don't
know, I could be trusted with this,

1755
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:49,160
but, I do think when you talk
to people working and then just like

1756
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:51,400
that.

1757
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:55,840
Yeah, but when I think of it as like,
oh, you like Google actually music.

1758
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,800
Because you basically thought
the model was kind of centered.

1759
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:04,000
Yeah, I think it's more and more like
I think it imitates thinking so.

1760
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,120
Well, it it's kind of eerie essentially.

1761
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:09,120
Yeah.

1762
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:10,880
Yeah.

1763
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:14,800
You need these moments
where it just acts weird and if you like,

1764
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:17,960
oh, thank God
it's still a computer, right.

1765
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,280
Those are the words.

1766
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,800
But would be like, really?

1767
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,520
The point, like, if you can hide.

1768
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,120
Yeah. Stuff.

1769
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:29,120
Yeah, yeah, you can put it.

1770
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,280
Oh, sorry.

1771
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,800
Okay.

1772
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,800
Go for.

1773
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,360
Yeah.

1774
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:40,360
Yeah yeah.

1775
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:43,360
Okay.

1776
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:56,640
Thanks. So.

1777
01:35:37,120 --> 01:36:03,040
Oh. I,

1778
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:28,080
Yeah.

1779
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:34,960
Okay.

1780
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:37,960
I'm gonna have to go throw.

1781
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Out! Gabby.

1782
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:51,080
We all love.

1783
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:22,840
This.

1784
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:25,840
Oh, my.

1785
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,720
Life.

1786
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:55,720
Oh, sorry.

1787
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:11,920
The the.

1788
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,800
Stuff.

1789
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:29,200
That's the different.

1790
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:55,480
Myself. Oh.

1791
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,880
That was like.

1792
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:21,080
Yeah.

1793
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:23,720
Basically, she brought it

1794
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:26,720
back, and that goes into the blueprint.

1795
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:37,120
Yeah.

1796
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:43,080
Yeah.

1797
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:44,480
That works.

1798
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:47,480
That's right. You.

1799
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:52,200
Remember?

1800
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:55,200
Yeah.

1801
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:04,640
Time where I.

1802
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,120
Was like.

1803
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:16,120
You talk about.

1804
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:16,960
Haha. Yes.

1805
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:20,840
I brought you here to see Horatio
Nelson, England's great naval hero.

1806
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:24,040
And Nelson's Column is put up immediately
after he wins

1807
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:27,360
the Battle of Trafalgar and is killed
during the Battle of Trafalgar.

1808
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,680
And I think it's such a great place to be
to talk about genius, because statues

1809
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,960
are one of the ways that we argue about
who deserves to be celebrated.

1810
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:39,600
That's right.

1811
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:43,200
Yeah, we do it.

1812
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,280
Yeah, yeah.

1813
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,920
Oh yeah.

1814
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:49,920
Because I have no.

1815
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:51,800
Yeah, yeah.

1816
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:55,080
So, Yeah,

1817
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:59,440
we're talking about,

1818
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:02,600
This is a pretty huge pedestal.

1819
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:06,120
And that is Horatio
Nelson, England's great naval hero.

1820
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:09,120
Nelson's column was built
to celebrate his victory over the French

1821
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:12,480
and the Spanish at the Battle
of Trafalgar, at which he also was killed.

1822
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:16,120
And the last couple of years, we've
had all these arguments about statues

1823
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:19,800
and the kind of part of the argument
about genius is to because it's about

1824
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,000
who do we celebrate?

1825
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,520
And do we still celebrate the same people
that we did 100 years ago, 200 years ago?

1826
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,520
So the ratio, Nelson, as far as
I understand, has not been canceled.

1827
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,040
But you will walk around London
and see statues of people who at the time

1828
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,480
were hailed as geniuses, who we now
feel are a bit more uncomfortable.

1829
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:40,200
There's a very big debate, for example,
about Britain's great war hero

1830
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:43,520
Winston Churchill, but who was also
involved in the Bengal famine.

1831
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,440
Actually, one of
the things that's great about being here

1832
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,440
is just around the corner behind me.
You can't see it.

1833
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:51,560
There's one of the very few statues
of a named woman, Edith Campbell,

1834
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:53,160
nurse during the First World War.

1835
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:56,160
And actually, one of the things you can
see, we talk about genius being very male.

1836
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:57,840
Statues are very male.

1837
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,840
Two, they represent
a very male type of achievement.

1838
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:04,040
And, you know, that's why the
the subject to many of the same debates

1839
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:07,040
that we have over geniuses.

1840
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:09,840
Would say maybe

1841
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,480
he got killed.

1842
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:14,480
It definitely helps
because he gave everything for

1843
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:18,560
for his country, you know, and,
and I also think it helps to have

1844
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:23,200
I mean, there's something very funny
almost, about how very big that column is.

1845
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:25,560
It's I think we would say extra.

1846
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:28,560
I don't think they would have described it
that way at me at the time,

1847
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:31,280
but it's very much like
I have got the biggest column.

1848
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:31,560
You know,

1849
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:35,280
there's plenty of statues around London,
but there's only one Nelson's Column.

1850
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:39,160
I know that is about the fact
that he was to the people

1851
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:42,560
who made that the greatest military
hero that we had at the time.

1852
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:45,880
What was it about us.

1853
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:48,160
That we

1854
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:50,200
as a species know

1855
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,680
what this is about is that we

1856
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:55,440
like to.

1857
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:58,440
Talk about something like.

1858
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,600
I think we love to put people on pedestals

1859
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:05,760
because it's a way of saying what we value
that statue is,

1860
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:09,120
and that column is to commemorate
somebody who gave their life

1861
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,840
for an idea of Britain,
an idea of the nation.

1862
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:14,320
Great time.

1863
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:15,000
So many things.

1864
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Like.

1865
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:30,720
It's on the mile in the middle of the.

1866
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:32,000
Yeah.

1867
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,840
I don't want to get run over that. I mean.

1868
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:37,160
I'm just asking for someone.

1869
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:38,520
Yeah.

1870
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:41,520
What is it about for me personally,

1871
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,280
I think we love to hero worship.

1872
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:46,920
I think that's
a pretty natural human impulse.

1873
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:50,920
And also to find out whether or not other
people value the same things that we do.

1874
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:54,120
You know, we don't want to
just listen to record alone.

1875
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:57,160
We want to go to a concert with loads
of other people who like that record, too.

1876
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,280
If we hail someone's a genius.

1877
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:02,840
We want to know that other people
value them to the same extent we do.

1878
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:06,120
In the case of a military hero,
you know, that's about saying,

1879
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:09,320
here's an idea of us as a nation
and this is what we all believe.

1880
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:12,240
And, you know, Nelson is a British hero.

1881
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:15,720
But what's interesting about being here is
you can also see the backlash

1882
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,000
and follow the square.

1883
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,160
So therefore lines
around the base of that plinth,

1884
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,440
there's also four separate plinths.

1885
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:25,800
And now for many decades that has been
the idea of the fourth plinth.

1886
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:29,840
And that has been about celebrating
different ideals for a long time.

1887
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,840
One of the statues on it,
very famously, was Marc

1888
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,360
Quinn's sculpture Alison Lapper Pregnant.

1889
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:36,880
And she had limb
shortening from, for the demise.

1890
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,440
And she was pregnant, so she didn't look
like people in classical statues do.

1891
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:44,440
And having that as a public artwork
was about saying we value something

1892
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:45,320
slightly differently.

1893
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:48,320
You know, we don't value
people who are quote unquote perfect.

1894
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:51,480
We value somebody who has made something
about life through struggle.

1895
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:54,920
And they have been more community
based, always about

1896
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:57,480
celebrating minorities
and marginalized people.

1897
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:59,760
And then you can see the push
and pull of the genius myth.

1898
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:03,040
Is it about celebrating
the great man on the pedestal,

1899
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:06,960
or do we need sometimes to celebrate
more ordinary lives, more ordinary people?

1900
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,040
Sorry.

1901
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,960
And yet
you can't put a team on a pedestal.

1902
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:17,280
That's probably where the genius of teams
is has gone wrong all these years.

1903
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:21,960
Okay, thank you. Yes.

1904
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:25,080
You mentioned the.

1905
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:51,480
I'm not sure all.

1906
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:54,320
I'm going to take you

1907
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:57,440
to see Edith Cavell,
who was a World War One nurse.

1908
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:59,640
And there's something
that's really interesting about the statue

1909
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:03,400
is that she was one of the very,
very few named women to get a statue.

1910
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,240
That happens
for all the reasons that you'd expect.

1911
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:07,440
You know, the great historians,

1912
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,800
the politicians, the prime ministers
throughout history have been men.

1913
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,000
And you get sometimes

1914
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
these female statues that are
about the personification in victory.

1915
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:19,080
But until very recently,
it has been extremely, extremely

1916
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:23,080
rare to have a woman who is celebrated
enough in her own right to get a statue.

1917
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:29,280
Yes, it's like, well.

1918
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:33,000
That's been around for quite a while,
but we do now have a new one,

1919
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,400
which is of Millicent Garrett
Fawcett in Parliament Square.

1920
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:37,760
She was a suffragist.

1921
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,640
She campaigned for women to get the vote.

1922
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:43,280
And what is important about that statue
is that it is the first female statue

1923
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:46,680
in Parliament Square, and it's someone
who campaigned for women to get the vote.

1924
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:50,280
So it's about saying women
belong in Parliament, women

1925
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:51,720
belong in Parliament Square.

1926
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:55,760
The genius of someone like Millicent
Garrett Fawcett, who organized

1927
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:59,000
a kind of army of suffragists
that deserves

1928
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
to be celebrated.

1929
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,560
For. It.

1930
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,520
So I'm taking you to see Edith Cavell,
who was one of the very

1931
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:15,000
few named women to have a statue in London
or actually anywhere in Britain.

1932
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:18,600
And I always make sure that I come and
look at the statue whenever I walk past.

1933
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:23,280
Phoebe.

1934
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:24,480
That's right.

1935
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:26,960
The night.

1936
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,600
So I'm taking you to see Edith Cavell,
who was a nurse

1937
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,080
during the First World War.

1938
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:33,080
And she's remarkable
because this is one of the very

1939
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:36,720
few statues we have in London
or anywhere in Britain, of a named woman

1940
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,600
who's not Queen Victoria.
There's a few Queen Victoria's.

1941
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:42,640
And I think this is interesting about what
Edith Cowan was being celebrated for.

1942
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:45,880
She was a nurse who treated both Allied
soldiers,

1943
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:49,200
German soldiers,
equally and was executed by firing squad.

1944
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:52,920
And when she died, she said, I bear
no ill will against anyone else.

1945
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:56,520
So she's being celebrated for a kind of
very feminine set of qualities,

1946
01:49:56,520 --> 01:50:00,000
which is a bit different
to what Nelson is being celebrated for.

1947
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,520
The kind of more male
genius, the military genius.

1948
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:23,640
You know, you know.

1949
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:34,240
That.

1950
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:37,240
Somehow it's also maybe.

1951
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,120
I get it like.

1952
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:42,160
We do have these little geniuses,

1953
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:46,480
and now we're sort of starting to order

1954
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:49,840
geniuses. Yeah.

1955
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,840
We can say, like.

1956
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:06,040
Who is the,

1957
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:08,440
But she's at all.

1958
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:09,600
It's very tempting to say,

1959
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,680
but actually, we can save ourselves
a lot of grief by not putting up statues.

1960
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:15,600
But that's like saying
we shouldn't have geniuses.

1961
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:19,120
The whole point of putting up a statue
is to have an argument about what

1962
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:21,800
you value and what you as a country
and a society value.

1963
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:25,600
And that's exactly the same reason
that we appoint someone to be a genius.

1964
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,720
Okay. What do we value in Edith Cavell?

1965
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:32,440
We value sacrifice and duty
and the type of patriotism that she said.

1966
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:34,040
It's not enough to have patriotism.

1967
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:36,000
You also have to kind of
have love for everybody.

1968
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
That's a specific set of ideals
that are being celebrated here.

1969
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,640
And that's the same thing that happens
when we pick a genius.

1970
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:43,840
When we anoint strings, it may sound,
we may know

1971
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:46,320
a Taylor Swift, you know,
what does Taylor Swift represent to us?

1972
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:49,560
Well, talent,
but also hard work, but also,

1973
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:51,440
you know, turning up and putting on a show

1974
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,680
every night of the week,
whatever it might be.

1975
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:55,160
It's how we talk about. Our values

1976
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:59,480
and the.

1977
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:00,960
She loves us.

1978
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:02,840
Yeah.

1979
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:05,840
So Edith Havel was a sorry.

1980
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:10,880
So Edith

1981
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:14,640
Cavell was a nurse during the First World
War who treated both sides equally.

1982
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:19,200
But she was executed by a German firing
squad and this was an outrage at the time.

1983
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,680
You know, they said, well,
what has she done?

1984
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:22,560
She's not an enemy combatant.

1985
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:26,000
And so there's a statue to her,
which is very rare for a woman,

1986
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:29,040
but because she represents something.

1987
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:30,800
And that's the argument
that I make all the way through.

1988
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:33,520
The genius
myth is that geniuses represent something.

1989
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:36,960
They get statues made to them,
they get museums dedicated to them

1990
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:40,160
because they represent something.

1991
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:45,160
We need to make more
of these people geniuses.

1992
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:46,640
Once we get that.

1993
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:50,080
I think there is a lively debate now about
whether or not she was secretly a spy.

1994
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:54,000
So even the most, you know,
apparently bland celebration of,

1995
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:58,040
you know, sort of nursing duty
might have a little edge to it underneath.

1996
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:01,320
And I don't think you can get away
from those arguments.

1997
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,880
You know, what I value is

1998
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,400
what I value is always going
to be different to what you value.

1999
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:08,880
And we have to find a way in a society
of kind of finding the middle ground

2000
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:09,880
between those things.

2001
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:11,360
But you might not want that statue.

2002
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:12,800
I might want this one.

2003
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,000
You might not want another one.
I might want it.

2004
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,680
And that's exactly the same with,
you know, who you hero.

2005
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:20,640
Worship is very different
to who I hero worship.

2006
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:23,040
But yeah, more, more weird statues.

2007
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:23,800
That's what I would like.

2008
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:26,800
One of the things that's been great about
the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square

2009
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,080
is just expanding the range of things
that count as public art,

2010
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:32,040
and I think that's that's wonderful.

2011
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:37,560
Right, right.

2012
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:46,960
Okay, there's one other thing

2013
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:49,960
I can say about this. Be.

2014
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:56,680
For the one.

2015
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:57,240
Of the other things

2016
01:53:57,240 --> 01:54:01,200
that's interesting about having public art
of somebody who talked about patriotism

2017
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:04,400
not being enough and died
in the First World War is that you quite

2018
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:08,080
often see anti-war protesters around here,
or people protesting around war crimes.

2019
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,280
And statues are a kind of focal point

2020
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:13,800
for those kind of discussions
in exactly the same way that it mattered.

2021
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:16,880
But Albert Einstein was very worried
about the nuclear bomb,

2022
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:19,440
because there was a person
that you could point to, a focus,

2023
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:23,040
a rallying point around
which you could have this big argument.

2024
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:25,400
He's a genius. He's worried about this.

2025
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:28,080
That makes it okay
for us to worry about it, too.

2026
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:31,440
Edith Cavell
shows in the dark side of of War,

2027
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:33,920
not the kind of glory
and the patriotism of it.

2028
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:36,720
So she becomes a focal point for people
to talk about things that they want

2029
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:37,400
to talk about.

2030
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:40,440
Let's stop here.

2031
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:41,480
Okay.

2032
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:42,640
It's on my way to work.

2033
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:46,360
So I kind of say hello to her quite often
in the morning when I go past, I don't

2034
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:48,080
I don't say hello to Nelson.

2035
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:50,040
I don't know that much about Nelson.

2036
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:53,720
And that's one of the interesting things
too, is that Nelson is a figure

2037
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:56,760
of national mythology
for British people, for English people,

2038
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:01,360
but actually not in the culture
in a particularly strong way.

2039
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:04,000
It will take somebody deciding
that they love Nelson,

2040
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,560
they want to make the Nelson biopic
or whatever it is to bring him back again.

2041
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:10,560
But yeah, I do, I do.

2042
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:12,200
Stop and say hello to Edith.

2043
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:15,200
Travel in the morning. But.

2044
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:21,120
He has a bit of a tormented forward.

2045
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:21,840
Kind of coping.

2046
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:25,080
I think that's just the extremely high
neckline.

2047
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:27,120
Yeah,

2048
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:28,520
but it's interesting that she's

2049
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:31,520
she's posed in a very heroic way.

2050
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:35,360
It's a very kind of it's
a very, like, manly striding pose.

2051
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:39,520
And again, that's why statues are part
of the kind of iconography of genius

2052
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:40,440
it's about in the same way

2053
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:44,400
the portraits are, it's about presenting
somebody as being grandeur.

2054
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:45,480
Why statues big?

2055
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,280
Why are people so often on horseback?

2056
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,840
It's about saying that they are
superhuman.

2057
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:51,120
They're different to us somehow.

2058
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:54,120
They're not like ordinary people.

2059
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:57,520
The geniuses.

2060
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:59,760
Thanks

2061
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:00,560
for the rain.

2062
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:01,040
Yeah.

2063
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:04,040
That.

2064
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:54,280
Is is it

2065
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:57,280
the offices in.

2066
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:01,040
Thank local radio.

2067
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:07,600
The barn.

2068
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:09,480
The kind of,

2069
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:12,760
more popular of the people.

2070
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:15,760
But sometimes you have cities. We have.

2071
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:18,840
Parts where it's just like, oh, that's.

2072
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:19,080
Great,

2073
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:21,280
right?

2074
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:24,280
Yeah.

2075
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:39,480
That's.

2076
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:03,120
Just.

2077
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:09,400
Yeah.

2078
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:11,760
Going.

2079
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:14,000
Going to start to.

2080
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:14,800
Send that to them.

2081
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:17,800
And the other one for.

2082
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:21,280
Okay.

2083
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:24,280
That's fine for.

2084
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:26,280
Yourself.

2085
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:28,920
Okay. You're going

2086
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:31,920
you're they, you're.

2087
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I it.

2088
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:42,840
Looks like a whole.

2089
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:48,800
The, like the ground floor.

2090
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,800
Your heart.

2091
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:12,520
Will be the

2092
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:14,680
on the kind of the home again.

2093
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:17,680
And there will be.

2094
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:22,360
More resources.

2095
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:23,120
There.

2096
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:26,120
When you're ready for.

2097
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:13,560
Really?

2098
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:55,840
Next, next.

2099
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:24,160
Month from there,

2100
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:36,680
we will follow you all the way around. We.

2101
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,920
Will ask you a question there.

2102
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:35,920
Or maybe here for a.

2103
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:51,200
Yeah, yeah.

2104
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:52,280
So this is.

2105
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:54,800
About this as great man as it gets, right?

2106
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,560
Was Winston Churchill a genius?

2107
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:58,920
If you want to start a fight
in a pub in Britain,

2108
02:05:58,920 --> 02:06:01,200
that's a pretty good question
to throw out there.

2109
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:04,840
To some people, Winston
Churchill is unquestionably a genius.

2110
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:08,960
If you look at how he came to power,
the Nazis were on the march.

2111
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:11,640
Britain was pursuing
a policy of appeasement,

2112
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:13,280
and he was the person who came in

2113
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:16,880
and said, there's you know, Britain
fights on Britain and Britain alone

2114
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:21,200
will stand against the Nazis,
and therefore he's a national hero.

2115
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:25,200
But there are some checkered bits
in the back story, too.

2116
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:26,280
He will too.

2117
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:29,280
Lots of people forever be associated
with the Bengal famine, which left

2118
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:32,760
millions dead in his career
as a kind of colonial overseer.

2119
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:37,320
And so people have these big debates,
which is the real Winston Churchill.

2120
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:41,680
Is he the genius who galvanized
this nation to stand against Nazis,

2121
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:46,440
or is he the kind of feckless
colonialist of the Bengal famine?

2122
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:49,320
Maybe he's and he's both.

2123
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:49,560
I mean,

2124
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:52,560
this is why we can always argue
about geniuses, because he's both

2125
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:55,360
you know, I think there's a huge amount
to be proud of.

2126
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:56,680
Winston Churchill.

2127
02:06:56,680 --> 02:07:00,560
But we don't need to airbrush
out the bad bits of the biography two.

2128
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:03,840
In fact, they're more interesting because
they're what makes him human, right?

2129
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:06,200
He's not just the guy on the pedestal.

2130
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:08,160
He was a real human being.

2131
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:10,840
And, you know, the other thing
that's become part of his mythology

2132
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:13,840
in recent years
is the black dog, his depression.

2133
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:18,000
He was somebody who suffered from really
poor mental health at certain times.

2134
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:21,600
But there's something noble
about the way that he nonetheless

2135
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:26,360
galvanized himself and the country
that really difficult and dark moments.

2136
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:29,800
Because also say something about us
that we need

2137
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:32,800
people like this
to have these kind of the trenches of

2138
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:35,560
torment

2139
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:38,560
where we used to just be like,
oh, he's a war hero, great guy.

2140
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:41,880
I think that's the thing
I think people were more comfortable

2141
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:44,880
at just having a straightforward
mythology of the great man.

2142
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:47,560
Now we want to hear about
how did the great man struggle

2143
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:50,040
and what did the great man
find difficult to do?

2144
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:52,920
And we want to see the real person
underneath.

2145
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:55,920
You know, if you watch
I watched The Darkest Hour,

2146
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:59,280
which is a Churchill biopic,
and there's scenes of him in the bath

2147
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:01,880
and this would have been,
you know, in 1950,

2148
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:04,880
that would have been a really shocking
thing to, to say and talk about.

2149
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:06,360
And now we kind of want that.

2150
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:08,080
We want the human side of the genius.

2151
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:09,480
Would you

2152
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:12,920
say he's like
an example of the queen of this great man

2153
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:16,440
theory of history, but also a great man?

2154
02:08:17,640 --> 02:08:20,560
I think he's an obvious example
of a great man of history.

2155
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:24,720
That decision to replace
Neville Chamberlain with Winston Churchill

2156
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:27,480
is a pivotal moment
in the Second World War,

2157
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:30,680
and that is exactly what Great man
theory is all about.

2158
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:34,160
It's about one person being
vitally important to the course of events.

2159
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:40,480
It's a part of who you stand on.

2160
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:42,400
Why do I stand on Winston Churchill?

2161
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:43,480
Yes. Oh, no.

2162
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:45,400
Look, I think that maybe.

2163
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:47,200
The Winston Churchill genius.

2164
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:51,120
Or Winston Churchill,
a political genius, undoubtedly,

2165
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:57,440
because what he did was taking a country
that needed to believe in itself

2166
02:08:57,760 --> 02:08:58,440
to do something

2167
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:01,800
which was undoubtedly morally correct,
which was stand against the Nazis.

2168
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:02,920
And he did that.

2169
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:05,040
He pulled everybody together.

2170
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:08,080
And to me, that is still
one of the most extraordinary

2171
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:11,080
things in Britain's history, and something
I think that Britain can still,

2172
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:13,400
80 years on, be incredibly proud about.

2173
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:18,040
But but I to say that I don't need
to airbrush out

2174
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:21,360
the earlier Winston Churchill
and I think that's the thing.

2175
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:23,160
But what do you think about people

2176
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:25,640
like that?

2177
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:28,640
You should have your you.

2178
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:32,160
You shouldn't, like, pry

2179
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:35,160
too much into these lines or.

2180
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:39,360
There it's a left wing, right
wing argument essentially,

2181
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:43,440
which is there's a feeling
that if you debunk Winston Churchill,

2182
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:48,360
that's taking something away from Britain,
that's taking away a particular story

2183
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:51,680
of Britain's history, saying
maybe Britain should be a bit more ashamed

2184
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:55,680
of its past versus people who say Britain,
we should be proud of our history.

2185
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:58,280
And this is an argument
that happens across Europe,

2186
02:09:58,280 --> 02:10:00,320
it happens in America,
it happens in Britain.

2187
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:02,280
And genius is a part of that story.

2188
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:04,200
Can you be proud of a genius?

2189
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:08,400
Can you be proud of an English genius
and what they say about England?

2190
02:10:08,680 --> 02:10:11,480
And that's wrapped up in
questions about patriotism.

2191
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:13,440
I guess is right.

2192
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:16,440
It is really the change.

2193
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:17,560
Yeah. That's right.

2194
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:20,160
Today I get this,

2195
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:22,440
you have this right
with the French, right?

2196
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:26,640
Just about all the stuff during the game.

2197
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:28,240
Powers like this guy.

2198
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:31,240
Right?

2199
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:35,080
With regret,

2200
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:39,280
for instance,
that you should feel about this, right?

2201
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:41,200
Community. Yeah.

2202
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:44,200
And we're all ready for the fight.

2203
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:50,880
He basically feels like this,

2204
02:10:52,360 --> 02:10:55,360
Let's face it this way.

2205
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:57,000
Some get the feeling.

2206
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:00,000
You know, I think you.

2207
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:02,880
I think you have to be an adult
about this stuff.

2208
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:05,880
I think that the fact that
Winston Churchill.

2209
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:09,080
Even more,

2210
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:12,080
I think after you said
with these rifles and.

2211
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:17,760
I'm going zero, but.

2212
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:21,000
Okay,
let's go through what can we just do?
